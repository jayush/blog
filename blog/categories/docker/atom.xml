    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following the release cycle of Hadoop, today we are releasing a new <code>2.5.1</code> version of our <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker/">Hadoop Docker container</a>. Up until today the container was only <code>CentOS</code> based, but during the last few months we got lots of requests to release a Hadoop container on <code>Ubuntu</code> as well. From now on we will have both released, supported and published to the official Docker repository. Enjoy.</p>

<h2>Centos</h2>

<h3>Build the image</h3>

<p>In case you&rsquo;d like to try directly from the <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker/tree/2.5.1">Dockerfile</a> you can build the image as:</p>

<p><code>
docker build  -t sequenceiq/hadoop-docker:2.5.1 .
</code></p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Pull the image</h3>

<p>As it is also released as an official Docker image from Docker&rsquo;s automated build repository &ndash; you can always pull or refer the image when launching containers.</p>

<p><code>
docker pull sequenceiq/hadoop-docker:2.5.1
</code></p>

<h3>Start a container</h3>

<p>In order to use the Docker image you have just build or pulled use:</p>

<p><code>
docker run -i -t sequenceiq/hadoop-docker:2.5.1 /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash
</code></p>

<h2>Ubuntu</h2>

<h3>Build the image</h3>

<p>In case you&rsquo;d like to try directly from the <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/docker-hadoop-ubuntu/tree/2.5.1">Dockerfile</a> you can build the image as:</p>

<p><code>
docker build  -t sequenceiq/hadoop-ubuntu:2.5.1 .
</code></p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Pull the image</h3>

<p>As it is also released as an official Docker image from Docker&rsquo;s automated build repository &ndash; you can always pull or refer the image when launching containers.</p>

<p><code>
docker pull sequenceiq/hadoop-ubuntu:2.5.1
</code></p>

<h3>Start a container</h3>

<p>In order to use the Docker image you have just build or pulled use:</p>

<p><code>
docker run -i -t sequenceiq/hadoop-ubuntu:2.5.1 /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash
</code></p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>You can run one of the stock examples:</p>

<p>```
cd $HADOOP_PREFIX</p>

<h1>run the mapreduce</h1>

<p>bin/hadoop jar share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.5.1.jar grep input output &lsquo;dfs[a-z.]+&rsquo;</p>

<h1>check the output</h1>

<p>bin/hdfs dfs -cat output/*
```</p>

<h2>Hadoop native libraries, build, Bintray, etc</h2>

<p>The Hadoop build process is no easy task &ndash; requires lots of libraries and their right version, protobuf, etc and takes some time &ndash; we have simplified all these, made the build and released a 64b version of Hadoop nativelibs on our <a href="https://bintray.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-bin/hadoop-native-64bit/2.5.0/view/files">Bintray repo</a>. Enjoy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you might be already familiar, we have <code>dockerized</code> most of the Hadoop ecosystem &ndash; we are running MR2, Spark, Storm, Hive, HBase, Pig, Oozie, etc in Docker containers &ndash; on bare metal and in the cloud as well. We have started to use (and contribute) to Docker quite a while ago, and beside the <code>mainstream</code> benefits of containers one feature was extremely appealing to us &ndash; <strong>the SOA way of DevOps</strong>.

<h2>Apache Drill at SequenceIQ</h2>

<p><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/drill/">Apache Drill</a> is an open source, low latency SQL query engine for Hadoop and NoSQL. It has many nice and interesting features, but one of the most interesting one (at least for us) is the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DRILL/Storage+Plugin+Registration">storage plugin</a> and the tolerance/support for dynamic schemas. At <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/">SequenceIQ</a> the pre and post processed data ends up in different storage systems/layers. Obliviously we use HDFS, for low latency queries we use HBase and recently (with the emergence of Tez &ndash; which we consider the next big thing) we started to use Hive as well. Quite often there is a need to access the data from <code>legacy</code> systems &ndash; and more often we see <code>SQL</code> coming back in the picture. Just FYI, for SQL on HBase we are using <a href="http://phoenix.apache.org/">Apache Phoenix</a>, and of course we have released and open sourced a <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/09/04/sql-on-hbase-with-apache-phoenix/">Docker container</a>.</p>

<p>As you see there are many storage systems use &ndash; and Drill helps us with aggregating these under one common <code>ANSI SQL syntax</code>. You can query data from HDFS, HBase, Hive, local or remote distributed file system &ndash; or write your own custom storage plugin.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Lifecycle of a Drill query</h3>

<p>Let’s take a simple example (from the Drill samples), where we query a file, with a <code>WHERE</code> clause. Your statement is submitted in <code>Sqlline</code> &ndash; a very popular (used with our Phoenix container as well) Java interface which can talk to a JDBC driver. The <code>SELECT</code> statement is passed into <a href="http://optiq.incubator.apache.org/">Optiq</a>. Optiq is a library for query parsing and planning, and allows pluggable transformation rules. Optiq also has a cost-based query optimizer. At high level, based on the above the statements are converted into Drill <code>logical operators</code>, and form a Drill logical plan. This plan is then submitted into one <code>DrillBit service</code> &ndash; usually running on each datanode, to benefit on the data locality, during query execution. This logical plan is then transformed into a physical plan &ndash; a simple DAG  of physical operators &ndash; using a Drill’s <code>optimizer</code>. This physical plan is broken into a multi-level execution tree (hello MPP) that is executed by multiple DrillBits. The story goes on as there are statistics collected, endpoint affinities are checked (metadata based preferred endpoint selection) and the plan is broken in fragments, but at a high level this is the execution flow.
There are some interesting things going on under the hood which we can cover it one of the following posts &ndash; about writing our custom storage plugin.</p>

<h2>Apache Drill on Docker</h2>

<p>Now as you have a good overview about the capabilities of Drill, we’d like to expand on what we mean under <strong>SOA way of DevOps</strong>. Though Drill is a complex piece of software, essentially the provided service is extremely simple: <em>queries data</em>. We have created a <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/drill/">Drill Docker</a> container and wrapped the <code>query</code> service inside. If you’d like to use Drill, the only thing you will have to do is to launch our Drill container &ndash; the <code>query service</code> is available <em>as a Service</em>. We have built the container in such a way that the data layer is separated from the <code>query service</code> &ndash; you can launch the container when and where you’d like to do, and attach the data using volumes. Once the data layer is attached, the only remaining thing is to let Drill know where to query &ndash; by either using one of the existing, or creating a new storage configuration.</p>

<h3>Pull the container</h3>

<p>The Drill container is available as a trusted build on Docker.io. You can get and start using it &ndash; the only prerequisite is to have Docker installed.</p>

<p><code>docker pull sequenceiq/drill</code></p>

<h3>Use the container</h3>

<p>Once the container is pulled you are ready to query your data by running:</p>

<p><code>docker run -it -v /data:/data sequenceiq/drill /etc/bootstrap.sh</code></p>

<p>Note that the <code>-v /data:/data</code> flag specifies that you are mounting your <code>/data</code> directory on the host into a <code>/data</code> directory inside the container. The files inside the directory will be available for Drill to query, by either using the default <code>dfs</code> storage plugin, or by a custom one. To check, or create a storage plugin or to access the Drill UI you should go to <code>http://CONTAINER_IP:8047</code>. You can find your container IP by using <code>docker inspect ID</code>.</p>

<p>In case you don&rsquo;t have any data, but would still like to explore Drill, start the contaier as:</p>

<p><code>docker run -it sequenceiq/drill /etc/bootstrap.sh</code></p>

<p>The sample data installed by default with Drill is available inside the container, thus you&rsquo;d be able to run all the Drill examples/tutorials.</p>

<h3>Drill Rest API</h3>

<p>Get Drillbit status: <code>http://localhost:8047/status</code>
Get all submitted queries: <code>http://localhost:8047/queries</code>
Get status of a given query:<code>http://localhost:8047/query/{QUERY_ID}</code></p>

<p>The next version of the container will be a fully distributed (based on our Hadoop container and Hazelcast) Apache Drill Docker container. Until then feel free to let us know how you <code>drill</code> and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sequenceiq/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sequenceiq">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sequenceiq">Facebook</a>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Docker intercontainer networking explained]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/12/docker-networking/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-12T08:53:15+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/12/docker-networking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this blog entry is to cover advanced topics regarding Docker networking and explain different concepts to inter-connect Docker containers when the containers are running on different host machines.
For the demonstration we are using VMs on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> launched with <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, but the explained networking concepts work also on Amazon EC2 (with VPC) and Azure unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>To set up the the test environment clone the <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples">SequenceIQ&rsquo;s samples repository</a> and follow the instructions.</p>

<p><code>
git clone git@github.com:sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples.git
cd sequenceiq-samples/docker-networking
vagrant up
</code></p>

<p>The <code>vagrant up</code> command launches the test setup, which conatins two Ubuntu 14.04 VMs with the network configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_nat">NAT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/private_network.html">Private networking</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The NAT (related to eth0 interface on VMs) is used only for access the external network from VMs e.g. download files from debian repository, but it is not used for inter-container communication. The Vagrant sets up a properly configured Host Only Networking in VirtualBox therefore the VMs can communicate with each other on the defined IP addresses:</p>

<ul>
<li>vm1: 192.168.40.11</li>
<li>vm2: 192.168.40.12</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see how Docker containers running on these VMs can send IP packets to each other.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Setting up bridge0</h2>

<p>The Docker attaches all containers to the virtual subnet implemented by docker0, this means that by default on both VMs the Docker containers will be launched with IP addresses from range 172.17.42.1/24. This is a problem for some of the solutions explained below, because if the containers on different hosts have the same IP addresses then we won&rsquo;t be able to properly route the IP packets between them. Therefore on each VMs a network bridge is created with the following subnets:</p>

<ul>
<li>vm1: 172.17.51.1/24</li>
<li>vm2: 172.17.52.1/24</li>
</ul>


<p>This means that every container luanched on vm1 will get an IP address from range 172.17.51.2 &ndash; 172.17.51.255 and containers on vm2 will have an address from range 172.17.52.2 &ndash; 172.17.52.255.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>do not execute, it was already executed on vm1 as root during provision from Vagrant</h1>

<p>brctl addbr bridge0
sudo ifconfig bridge0 172.17.51.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
sudo bash -c &lsquo;echo DOCKER_OPTS=\&ldquo;-b=bridge0\&rdquo; >> /etc/default/docker&rsquo;
sudo service docker restart</p>

<h1>do not execute, it was already executed on vm1 as root during provision from Vagrant</h1>

<p>sudo brctl addbr bridge0
sudo ifconfig bridge0 172.17.52.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
sudo bash -c &lsquo;echo DOCKER_OPTS=\&ldquo;-b=bridge0\&rdquo; >> /etc/default/docker&rsquo;
sudo service docker restart
```</p>

<p>As noted in the comments the above configuration is already executed during the provisioning of VMs and it was copied here just for the sake of clarity and completeness.</p>

<h2>Expose container ports to host</h2>

<p>Probably the simplest way to solve inter-container communication is to expose ports from container to the host. This can be done with the <code>-p</code> switch. E.g. exposing the port 3333 is as simple as:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1 -p 3333:3333 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -l 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -w 1 -v 192.168.40.11 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 192.168.40.11 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>This might be well suited for cases when the communication ports are defined in advance (e.g. MySQL will run on port 3306), but will not work when the application uses dynamic ports for communication (like Hadoop does with IPC ports).</p>

<h2>Host networking</h2>

<p>If the container is started with <code>--net=host</code> then it avoids placing the container inside of a separate network stack, but as the Docker documentation says this option &ldquo;tells Docker to not containerize the container&rsquo;s networking&rdquo;. The <code>cont1</code> container can bind directly to the network interface of host therefore the <code>nc</code> will be available directly on 192.168.40.11.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1 &mdash;net=host ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -l 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -w 1 -v 192.168.40.11 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 192.168.40.11 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Of course if you want to access cont2 from cont1 then cont2 also needs to be started with <code>--net=host</code> option.
The host networking is very powerful solution for inter-container communication, but it has its drawbacks, since the ports used by the container can collide with the ports used by host or other containers utilising &mdash;net=host option, because all of them are sharing the same network stack.</p>

<h2>Direct Routing</h2>

<p>So far we have seen methods where the containers have used the IP address of host to communicate with each other, but there are solutions to inter-connect the containers by using their own IPs. If we are using the containers own IPs for routing then it is important that we shall be able to distinguish based on IP which container is running on vm1 and which one is running on on vm2, this was the reason why the bridge0 interface was created as explained in &ldquo;Setting up bridge0&rdquo; section.
To make the things a bit easier to understand I have created a simplified diagram of the network interfaces in our current test setup. If I would like to oversimplify the thing then I would say that, we shall setup the routing in that way that the packets from one container are following the red lines shown on the diagram.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class="<a" src="href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/routing.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/routing.png</a>"></p>

<p>To achive this we need to configure the routing table on hosts in that way that every packet which destination is 172.17.51.0/24 is forwarded to vm1 and every IP packet where the destination is 172.17.52.0/24 is forwarded to vm2. To repeat it shortly, the containers running on vm1 are placed to subnet 172.17.51.0/24, containers on vm2 are on subnet 172.17.52.0/24.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.40.12
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0  netmask 255.255.255.0  gw 192.168.40.11
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>route add</code> command adds the desired routing to the route table, but you might wonder why the iptables configuration is necessary. The reason for that the Docker by default sets up a rule to the nat table to masquerade all IP packets that are leaving the machine. In our case we definitely don&rsquo;t want this, therefore we delete all MASQUERADE rules with -F option. At this point we already would be able to make the connection from one container to other and vice verse, but the containers would not be able to communicate with the outside world, therefore an iptables rule needs to be added to masquerade the packets that are going outside of 172.17.0.0/16. I need to mention the another approach would be to use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/articles/networking/#between-containers">&mdash;iptables=false</a> option of the daemon to avoid any manipulation in the iptables and you can do all the config manually.</p>

<p>Such kind of direct routing from one vm to other vm works great and easy to set up, but cannot be used if the hosts are not on the same subnet. If the host are located the on different subnet the tunneling might be an option as you will see it in the next section.</p>

<p><em>Note: This solution works on Amazon EC2 instances only if the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html#EIP_Disable_SrcDestCheck">Source/Destionation Check</a> is disabled.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: Due to the packet filtering policy of Azure this method cannot be used there.</em></p>

<h2>Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel</h2>

<p>GRE is a tunneling protocol that can encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links.
The main idea is to create a GRE tunnel between the VMs and send all traffic through it:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class="<a" src="href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/gre.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/gre.png</a>"></p>

<p>In order to create a tunnel you need to specify the name, the type (which is gre in our case) and the IP address of local and the remote end. Consequently the tun2 name used for the tunnel on on vm1 since from vm1 perspective that is the tunnel endpoint which leads to vm2 and every packet sent to tun2 to will eventually come out on vm2 end.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>GRE tunnel config execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo iptunnel add tun2 mode gre local 192.168.40.11 remote 192.168.40.12
sudo ifconfig tun2 10.0.201.1
sudo ifconfig tun2 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun2
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>GRE tunnel config execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo iptunnel add tun1 mode gre local 192.168.40.12 remote 192.168.40.11
sudo ifconfig tun1 10.0.202.1
sudo ifconfig tun1 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun1
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>After the tunnel is set up and activated the remaining commands are very similar to the commands executed in the &ldquo;Direct Routing&rdquo; section. The main difference here is that we do not route the traffic directly to other vm, but we are routing it into <code>dev tun1</code> and <code>dev tun2</code> respectively.</p>

<p>With GRE tunnels a point-to-point connection is set up between two hosts, which means that if you have more then two hosts in your network and want to interconnect all of them, then n-1 tunnel endpoint needs to be created on every host, which will be quite challenging to maintain if you have a large cluster.</p>

<p><em>Note: GRE packets are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn133803.aspx">filtered out</a> on Azure therefore this solution cannot be used there.</em></p>

<h2>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h2>

<p>If more secured connections is required between containers then VPNs can be used on VMs. This addiotional security might significantly increase processing overhead. This overhead is highly depends on which VPN solution are you going to use. In this demo we use the VPN capabilities of SSH which is not really suited for production use. In order to enable the VPN capabilites of ssh the  PermitTunnel parameter needs to be switched on in sshd_config. If you are using the Vagranfile provided to this tutorial then nothing needs to be done, since this parameter was already set up for you during provisioning in the bootstrap.sh.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo ssh -f -N -w 2:1 <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x72;&#x6f;&#x6f;&#116;&#64;&#49;&#57;&#x32;&#46;&#x31;&#x36;&#56;&#x2e;&#52;&#x30;&#46;&#49;&#x32;">&#x72;&#111;&#111;&#116;&#x40;&#49;&#x39;&#50;&#46;&#x31;&#x36;&#x38;&#x2e;&#52;&#48;&#46;&#49;&#50;</a>
sudo ifconfig tun2 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun2
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo ifconfig tun1 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun1
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The ssh is launched with -w option where the numerical ids of tun devices were specified. After executing the command the tunnel interfaces are created on both VMs. The interfaces needs to be be activated with ifconfig up and after that we need to setup the rooting to direct the traffic to  172.17.51.0/24 and 172.17.52.0/24 to tun2 and tun1.</p>

<p>As mentioned the VPN capabilities of SSH is not recommended in production, but other solutions like  <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html">OpenVPN</a> would worth a try to secure the communication between the hosts (and also between the containers).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The above examples were hand written mainly for demonstration purposes, but there are great tools like <a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework">Pipework</a> that can make your life simpler and will do the heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p>If you want to check how these methods are working in production environment you are just a few clicks from it, since under the hood these methods are responsible to solve the inter-container communication in our cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API called <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a>.</p>

    <updated>2014-08-04T19:43:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/04/launch-docker-containers-on-azure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago we have open sourced our cloud agnostic and Docker based Hadoop as a Service API &ndash; called <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak">Cloudbreak</a>.
The first public beta version supports Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure, while we are already wrapping up a few new cloud provider integrations.</p>

<p>While there is some documentation about running Docker containers on Amazon, there is no detailed description about running Docker on the Azure cloud.
With this blog post we would like to shed some light on it &ndash; recently there have been lots of announcements from Microsoft about Docker support (Azure CLI, Kubernetes, libswarm) but they are either not finished yet or are not ready to build a robust platform on top.
We are eagerly waiting for the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/07/10/azure-collaboration-with-google-and-docker/">Kubernetes integration</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you are interested in running a <code>cluster</code> of Docker container, or do some more complex stuff then read on.</p>

<p>Just to briefly recap &ndash; with Cloudbreak we are launching on demand Hadoop clusters (check our <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/25/cloudbreak-technology/">blog</a> for further technical details) in Docker containers. These containers are <code>shipped</code> to different cloud VMsm and dynamically find and join each other &ndash; they form a fully functional Hadoop cluster without the need to do anything manually on the host, or apply any manual pre-configuration.
So how are we doing this?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Docker ready base VM image</h3>

<p>First of all you need a base image with Docker installed &ndash; thus for that we have built and made available an Ubuntu 14.04 image with Docker installed. Apart from Docker, to build a fully dynamic and <code>service discovery</code> aware Docker cluster we needed <a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/basicnet/bridge-utils.html"> bridge-utils</a>.</p>

<p>Once this base image is created you will need to make it public and re-usable. In order to do that the image has to be published in <a href="http://vmdepot.msopentech.com/List/Index">VMdepot</a>. When you are about to use an image from VM depot, and create a VM based on that you will need to copy it in your own storage account &ndash; note that doing it at first time this can be a slow process (20-25 minutes, copying the 30 GB image).</p>

<h3>Dynamic networking</h3>

<p>Now you have an image based on that you can launch your own VMs, and the Docker container inside your VM. While there are a few options to do that, we needed to find a unified way to do so &ndash; note that  <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak">Cloudbreak</a> is a cloud agnostic solution &ndash; and we do not want to create init scripts for each and every cloud environment we use. Amazon’s AWS has a feature so called <code>userdata</code> &ndash; an option of passing data to the instance that can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. You can pass two types of user data to Amazon AWS: shell scripts and cloud-init directives. In order to keep the launch process unified everywhere we are using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit">cloud-init</a> on Azure as well.</p>

<p>You can use/start Docker with different networking setup &ndash; using a bridged network or using the host network. You can check the init scripts in our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/blob/master/src/main/resources/azure-init.sh">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

<p><strong>Bridged network</strong></p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>set bridge0 in docker opts</h1>

<p>sh -c &ldquo;cat > /etc/default/docker&rdquo; &lt;&lt;&ldquo;EOF&rdquo;
DOCKER_OPTS=&ldquo;-b bridge0 -H unix:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375&rdquo;
EOF</p>

<p>CMD=&ldquo;docker run -d -p SOURCE_PORT:DESTINATION_PORT 0 -e SERF_JOIN_IP=$SERF_JOIN_IP -e SERF_ADVERTISE_IP=$MY_IP &mdash;dns 127.0.0.1 &mdash;name ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX} -h ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX}.${MYDOMAIN} &mdash;entrypoint /usr/local/serf/bin/start-serf-agent.sh  $IMAGE $AMBARI_ROLE&rdquo;</p>

<p>```
<strong>Host network</strong></p>

<p><code>bash
CMD="docker run -d -e SERF_JOIN_IP=$AMBARI_SERVER_IP --net=host --name ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX} --entrypoint /usr/local/serf/bin/start-serf-agent.sh  $IMAGE $AMBARI_ROLE"
</code></p>

<p><em>Note: for cloud based clusters we are giving up on the bridged based network &ndash; mostly due to Azure&rsquo;s networking limitations &ndash; and will use the <code>net=host</code> solution in the next release. The bridged network will still be a supported solution, though we are using it mostly with bare metal or multi container/host solutions.</em></p>

<p>Azure has (comparing with Amazon’s AWS or Google’s Cloud compute) an <code>uncommon</code> network setup and supports limited flexibility &ndash; in order to overcome these, and still have a dynamic Hadoop cluster different scenarios / use cases requires different Docker networking &ndash; that is quite a large <strong>undocumented</strong> topic which we will cover in our next blog posts &ndash; in particular the issues, differences and solutions to use Docker on different cloud providers. While we have briefly talked about <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#technology">Serf</a> in the <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> documentation, we will enter in deep technical details in one of our next posts as well.

<h3>SequenceIQ’s Azure REST API &ndash; open sourced</h3>

<p>At <a href="htp://sequenceiq.com">SequenceIQ</a> we always automate everything &ndash; and in order to launch VM instances, configure networks, start containers, etc we needed a REST client which we can use it from our JAVA and Scala codebase. Since the Microsoft API is XML based &ndash; <em>yo, it’s 2014</em> &ndash; we have created and open sourced a Groovy based <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/azure-rest-client">Azure REST API</a> &ndash; wrapping the XML calls into a nice, easy to use and clean REST API. Feel free to use it &ndash; it’s open sourced under an Apache 2 license. Note that <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> does not store your Azure user credential &ndash; whereas with the defulat Azue CLI that would have been possible &ndash; the only thing we need from your side to work is your subscription id. The process is documented here: <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#accounts.">http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#accounts.</a></p>

<h3>Metadata service for Azure</h3>

<p>The another nice feature we have created for Azure VMs is a <code>metadata service</code>. While a service as such does exists on Amazon’s AWS it’s missing from Microsoft Azure &ndash; note that our Cloudbreak solution is a cloud agnostic one, and we always strive to use identical solution on all cloud providers. The instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instances &ndash; and available via a REST call. We have developed a service as such for Azure &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/service/stack/connector/azure/AzureMetadataSetup.java">AzureMetadataSetup</a>. As you can see we collect the metadata, and make it available under a <code>unique hash</code> for each cluster by calling the following resource: <code>/metadata/{hash}</code></p>

<p>```java
private Set<CoreInstanceMetaData> collectMetaData(Stack stack, AzureClient azureClient, String name) {</p>

<pre><code>... try {
            CoreInstanceMetaData instanceMetaData = new CoreInstanceMetaData(vmName,
                    getPrivateIP((String) virtualMachine),
                    getVirtualIP((String) virtualMachine));
            instanceMetaDatas.add(instanceMetaData);
        } catch (IOException e) { ...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```
This service is used in a few cases &ndash; for example to learn different network setups as the hosts are using different network options than the Docker containers.</p>

<p>As usual for us &ndash; being committed to 100% open source &ndash; we are always open sourcing everything thus you can get the details on our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak">GitHub</a> repository.
