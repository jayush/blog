    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago we have open sourced our cloud agnostic and Docker based Hadoop as a Service API &ndash; called <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak">Cloudbreak</a>.
The first public beta version supports Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure, while we are already wrapping up a few new cloud provider integrations.</p>

<p>While there is some documentation about running Docker containers on Amazon, there is no detailed description about running Docker on the Azure cloud.
With this blog post we would like to shed some light on it &ndash; recently there have been lots of announcements from Microsoft about Docker support (Azure CLI, Kubernetes, libswarm) but they are either not finished yet or are not ready to build a robust platform on top.
We are eagerly waiting for the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/07/10/azure-collaboration-with-google-and-docker/">Kubernetes integration</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you are interested in running a <code>cluster</code> of Docker container, or do some more complex stuff then read on.</p>

<p>Just to briefly recap &ndash; with Cloudbreak we are launching on demand Hadoop clusters (check our <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/25/cloudbreak-technology/">blog</a> for further technical details) in Docker containers. These containers are <code>shipped</code> to different cloud VMsm and dynamically find and join each other &ndash; they form a fully functional Hadoop cluster without the need to do anything manually on the host, or apply any manual pre-configuration.
So how are we doing this?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Docker ready base VM image</h3>

<p>First of all you need a base image with Docker installed &ndash; thus for that we have built and made available an Ubuntu 14.04 image with Docker installed. Apart from Docker, to build a fully dynamic and <code>service discovery</code> aware Docker cluster we needed <a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/basicnet/bridge-utils.html"> bridge-utils</a>.</p>

<p>Once this base image is created you will need to make it public and re-usable. In order to do that the image has to be published in <a href="http://vmdepot.msopentech.com/List/Index">VMdepot</a>. When you are about to use an image from VM depot, and create a VM based on that you will need to copy it in your own storage account &ndash; note that doing it at first time this can be a slow process (20-25 minutes, copying the 30 GB image).</p>

<h3>Dynamic networking</h3>

<p>Now you have an image based on that you can launch your own VMs, and the Docker container inside your VM. While there are a few options to do that, we needed to find a unified way to do so &ndash; note that  <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak">Cloudbreak</a> is a cloud agnostic solution &ndash; and we do not want to create init scripts for each and every cloud environment we use. Amazon’s AWS has a feature so called <code>userdata</code> &ndash; an option of passing data to the instance that can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. You can pass two types of user data to Amazon AWS: shell scripts and cloud-init directives. In order to keep the launch process unified everywhere we are using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit">cloud-init</a> on Azure as well.</p>

<p>You can use/start Docker with different networking setup &ndash; using a bridged network or using the host network. You can check the init scripts in our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/blob/master/src/main/resources/azure-init.sh">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

<p><strong>Bridged network</strong></p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>set bridge0 in docker opts</h1>

<p>sh -c &ldquo;cat > /etc/default/docker&rdquo; &lt;&lt;&ldquo;EOF&rdquo;
DOCKER_OPTS=&ldquo;-b bridge0 -H unix:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375&rdquo;
EOF</p>

<p>CMD=&ldquo;docker run -d -p SOURCE_PORT:DESTINATION_PORT 0 -e SERF_JOIN_IP=$SERF_JOIN_IP -e SERF_ADVERTISE_IP=$MY_IP &mdash;dns 127.0.0.1 &mdash;name ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX} -h ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX}.${MYDOMAIN} &mdash;entrypoint /usr/local/serf/bin/start-serf-agent.sh  $IMAGE $AMBARI_ROLE&rdquo;</p>

<p>```
<strong>Host network</strong></p>

<p><code>bash
CMD="docker run -d -e SERF_JOIN_IP=$AMBARI_SERVER_IP --net=host --name ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX} --entrypoint /usr/local/serf/bin/start-serf-agent.sh  $IMAGE $AMBARI_ROLE"
</code></p>

<p><em>Note: for cloud based clusters we are giving up on the bridged based network &ndash; mostly due to Azure&rsquo;s networking limitations &ndash; and will use the <code>net=host</code> solution in the next release. The bridged network will still be a supported solution, though we are using it mostly with bare metal or multi container/host solutions.</em></p>

<p>Azure has (comparing with Amazon’s AWS or Google’s Cloud compute) an <code>uncommon</code> network setup and supports limited flexibility &ndash; in order to overcome these, and still have a dynamic Hadoop cluster different scenarios / use cases requires different Docker networking &ndash; that is quite a large <strong>undocumented</strong> topic which we will cover in our next blog posts &ndash; in particular the issues, differences and solutions to use Docker on different cloud providers. While we have briefly talked about <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#technology">Serf</a> in the <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> documentation, we will enter in deep technical details in one of our next posts as well. Should you be interested in these, make sure you follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sequenceiq/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sequenceiq">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook">Facebook</a> for updates.</p>

<h3>SequenceIQ’s Azure REST API &ndash; open sourced</h3>

<p>At <a href="htp://sequenceiq.com">SequenceIQ</a> we always automate everything &ndash; and in order to launch VM instances, configure networks, start containers, etc we needed a REST client which we can use it from our JAVA and Scala codebase. Since the Microsoft API is XML based &ndash; <em>yo, it’s 2014</em> &ndash; we have created and open sourced a Groovy based <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/azure-rest-client">Azure REST API</a> &ndash; wrapping the XML calls into a nice, easy to use and clean REST API. Feel free to use it &ndash; it’s open sourced under an Apache 2 license. Note that <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> does not store your Azure user credential &ndash; whereas with the defulat Azue CLI that would have been possible &ndash; the only thing we need from your side to work is your subscription id. The process is documented here: <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#accounts.">http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#accounts.</a></p>

<h3>Metadata service for Azure</h3>

<p>The another nice feature we have created for Azure VMs is a <code>metadata service</code>. While a service as such does exists on Amazon’s AWS it’s missing from Microsoft Azure &ndash; note that our Cloudbreak solution is a cloud agnostic one, and we always strive to use identical solution on all cloud providers. The instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instances &ndash; and available via a REST call. We have developed a service as such for Azure &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/service/stack/connector/azure/AzureMetadataSetup.java">AzureMetadataSetup</a>. As you can see we collect the metadata, and make it available under a <code>unique hash</code> for each cluster by calling the following resource: <code>/metadata/{hash}</code></p>

<p>```java
private Set<CoreInstanceMetaData> collectMetaData(Stack stack, AzureClient azureClient, String name) {</p>

<pre><code>... try {
            CoreInstanceMetaData instanceMetaData = new CoreInstanceMetaData(vmName,
                    getPrivateIP((String) virtualMachine),
                    getVirtualIP((String) virtualMachine));
            instanceMetaDatas.add(instanceMetaData);
        } catch (IOException e) { ...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```
This service is used in a few cases &ndash; for example to learn different network setups as the hosts are using different network options than the Docker containers.</p>

<p>As usual for us &ndash; being committed to 100% open source &ndash; we are always open sourcing everything thus you can get the details on our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak">GitHub</a> repository.
Should you have any questions feel free to engage with us on our <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/">blog</a> or follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sequenceiq/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sequenceiq">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook">Facebook</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/25/cloudbreak-technology/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-25T12:56:39+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/25/cloudbreak-technology</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A week ago we have <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/18/announcing-cloudbreak/">announced</a> and open sourced <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak</a>, the first Docker based Hadoop as a Service API. In this post we&rsquo;d like to introduce you into the technical details and the building blocks of the architecture.
Cloudbreak is built on the foundation of cloud providers APIs, Apache Ambari, Docker containers, Serf and dnsmasq. It is a cloud agnostic solution &ndash; as all the Hadoop services and components are running inside Docker containers &ndash; and these containers are shipped across different cloud providers.</p>

<p>Cloudbreak product documentation: <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak">http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak</a></p>

<p>Cloudbreak API documentation: <a href="http://docs.cloudbreak.apiary.io/">http://docs.cloudbreak.apiary.io/</a></p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>From Docker containers point of view we have two kind of containers &ndash; based on their Ambari role &ndash; server and agent. There is one Docker container running the Ambari server, and there are many Docker containers running the Ambari agents. The used Docker image is always the same: <code>sequenceiq/ambari</code> and
the Ambari role is decided based on the <code>$AMBARI_ROLE</code> variable.</p>

<p>For example on Amazon EC2 this is how we start the containers:</p>

<p><code>bash
docker run -d -p &lt;LIST of ports&gt; -e SERF_JOIN_IP=$SERF_JOIN_IP --dns 127.0.0.1 --name ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX} -h ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX}.${MYDOMAIN} --entrypoint /usr/local/serf/bin/start-serf-agent.sh  $IMAGE $AMBARI_ROLE
</code></p>

<p>As we are starting up the instances and the Docker containers on the host, we&rsquo;d like them to join each other and be able to communicate &ndash; though we don&rsquo;t know the IP addresses beforehand. This can be challanging on cloud environments &ndash; where your IP address and DNS name is dynamically allocated &ndash; however you don&rsquo;t want to collect these imformations beforehand launching the Docker containers.
For that we use Serf &ndash; and pass along the IP address <code>SERF_JOIN_IP=$SERF_JOIN_IP</code> of the first container. Using a gossip protocol Serf will automatically discover each other, set the DNS names, and configure the routing between the nodes.
Serf reconfigures the DNS server <code>dnsmasq</code> running inside the container, and keeps it up to date with the joining or leaving nodes information.
As you can see at startup we always pass a <code>--dns 127.0.0.1</code> dns server for the container to use.</p>

<p>As you see there is no cloud specific code at the Docker containers level, the same technology can be used on bare metal as well.
Check our previous blog posts about a <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/06/19/multinode-hadoop-cluster-on-docker/">multi node Hadoop cluster on any host</a>.</p>

<p>Obliviously there is some configuration on the host as well &ndash; for that and to handle early initialization of a cloud instance we use <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit">CloudInit</a>. We will write a blog post about these for every cloud provider we support.</p>

<p>For additional information you can check our slides from the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JanosMatyas/docker-based-hadoop-provisioning">Hadoop Summit 2014</a>.</p>

<p>Once Ambari is started it will install the selected components based on the passed Hadoop blueprint &ndash; and start the desired services.</p>

<h2>Used Technologies</h2>

<h3>Apache Ambari</h3>

<p>The Apache Ambari project is aimed at making Hadoop management simpler by developing software for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters. Ambari provides an intuitive, easy-to-use Hadoop management web UI backed by its RESTful APIs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/docs/images/ambari-overview.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ambari enables System Administrators to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Provision a Hadoop Cluster</li>
<li>provides a step-by-step wizard for installing Hadoop services across any number of hosts.</li>
<li><p>handles configuration of Hadoop services for the cluster.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage a Hadoop Cluster</p></li>
<li><p>provides central management for starting, stopping, and reconfiguring Hadoop services across the entire cluster.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor a Hadoop Cluster</p></li>
<li>provides a dashboard for monitoring health and status of the Hadoop cluster.</li>
<li>leverages Ganglia for metrics collection.</li>
<li>leverages Nagios for system alerting and will send emails when your attention is needed (e.g. a node goes down, remaining disk space is low, etc).</li>
</ol>


<p>Ambari enables to integrate Hadoop provisioning, management and monitoring capabilities into applications with the Ambari REST APIs.
Ambari Blueprints are a declarative definition of a cluster. With a Blueprint, you can specify a Stack, the Component layout and the Configurations to materialize a Hadoop cluster instance (via a REST API) without having to use the Ambari Cluster Install Wizard.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/docs/images/ambari-create-cluster.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3>Docker</h3>

<p>Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.</p>

<p>The main features of Docker are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lightweight, portable</li>
<li>Build once, run anywhere</li>
<li>VM &ndash; without the overhead of a VM</li>
<li>Each virtualized application includes not only the application and the necessary binaries and libraries, but also an entire guest operating system</li>
<li><p>The Docker Engine container comprises just the application and its dependencies. It runs as an isolated process in userspace on the host operating system, sharing the kernel with other containers.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/docs/images/vm.png" alt="" /></p></li>
<li><p>Containers are isolated</p></li>
<li>It can be automated and scripted</li>
</ol>


<h3>Serf</h3>

<p>Serf is a tool for cluster membership, failure detection, and orchestration that is decentralized, fault-tolerant and highly available. Serf runs on every major platform: Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It is extremely lightweight.
Serf uses an efficient gossip protocol to solve three major problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Membership: Serf maintains cluster membership lists and is able to execute custom handler scripts when that membership changes. For example, Serf can maintain the list of Hadoop servers of a cluster and notify the members when nodes come online or go offline.</p></li>
<li><p>Failure detection and recovery: Serf automatically detects failed nodes within seconds, notifies the rest of the cluster, and executes handler scripts allowing you to handle these events. Serf will attempt to recover failed nodes by reconnecting to them periodically.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/docs/images/serf-gossip.png" alt="" /></p></li>
<li><p>Custom event propagation: Serf can broadcast custom events and queries to the cluster. These can be used to trigger deploys, propagate configuration, etc. Events are simple fire-and-forget broadcast, and Serf makes a best effort to deliver messages in the face of offline nodes or network partitions. Queries provide a simple realtime request/response mechanism.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/docs/images/serf-event.png" alt="" /></p></li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/18/announcing-cloudbreak/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-18T16:37:37+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/18/announcing-cloudbreak</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Cloudbreak is a powerful left surf that breaks over a coral reef, a mile off southwest the island of Tavarua, Fiji.</em></p>

<p><em>Cloudbreak is a cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API. Abstracts the provisioning and ease management and monitoring of on-demand clusters.</em></p>

<p>Today is a big day for us and the Hadoop community &ndash; we are announcing the first <code>public beta</code> version of our open source and cloud agnostic <strong>Hadoop as a Service API</strong>.</p>

<p>During our daily work with large Hadoop clusters in the cloud, <code>dockerized</code> environments and bare metal we were doing the same things over and over again. Although we are automating and <code>dockerizing</code> always everything, we felt that something is missing &ndash; an open source, cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API. Welcome <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> &ndash; you are one POST away from your on-demand Hadoop cluster on your favorite cloud provider.</p>

<p>When we have started to work on Cloudbreak &ndash; first of all to solve our internal needs at SequenceIQ &ndash; we have set the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use open source software and be <strong>100% open source</strong> under Apache 2 license</li>
<li>Have the ability to quickly launch arbitrary sized Hadoop clusters</li>
<li>Be cloud provider agnostic and create an SDK which allows to quickly add new providers</li>
<li>No more glue code, repeating the same things over and over again</li>
<li>Have a REST API and a CLI in order to be able to automate the whole process</li>
<li>Create an easy to use and responsive UI</li>
<li>Support different Hadoop services and configurations in a declarative way</li>
<li>Elastic and flexible, with the ability to resize running clusters</li>
<li>Secure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Docker in the cloud</h2>

<p>At <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/">SequenceIQ</a> we are running all our core applications and processes in Docker containers &ndash; and that is true for Hadoop and all of the services as well. During the last few months we have <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/06/19/multinode-hadoop-cluster-on-docker/">blogged</a> and open sourced all of the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/">building blocks</a> of our <code>dockerized</code> systems and <strong>Cloudbreak</strong> is built on the foundation of these and reusing the same technologies we have released before. While Cloudbreak&rsquo;s primary role is to launch on-demand Hadoop clusters in the cloud, the underlying technology actually does more. It can launch on-demand Hadoop clusters in any environment which supports Docker &ndash; in a dynamic way. There is no predefined configuration needed as all the setup, orchestration, networking and cluster membership is done dynamically.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/">Docker containers</a> &ndash; all the Hadoop services are installed and running inside Docker containers, and these containers are <code>shipped</code>  between different cloud vendors, keeping Cloudbreak cloud agnostic</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/ambari-rest-client">Apache Ambari</a> &ndash; to declaratively define a Hadoop cluster</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/docker-serf">Serf</a> &ndash; for cluster membership, failure detection, and orchestration that is decentralized, fault-tolerant and highly available for dynamic clusters</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/docker-dnsmasq">dnsmasq</a> &ndash; to provide resolvable fully qualified domain names between dynamically created Docker containers.</li>
</ul>


<p>The project was presented at the <strong>Hadoop Summit 2014,</strong> in San Jose &ndash; you can get the slides from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JanosMatyas/docker-based-hadoop-provisioning">here</a>.</p>

<p>While there is an extensive list of articles explaining the benefits of using Docker, we would like to highlight our motivations in a few bullet points.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write once, run anywhere &ndash; our solution uses the same Docker containers on different cloud providers, <code>dockerized</code>  environments or bare metal, no difference at all</li>
<li>Reproducible, testable environment &ndash; we are recreating complete config environments in seconds, and being able to work with the same containers on our laptop, QA and production/cloud environments</li>
<li>Isolation &ndash; each container is separated and runs in its own isolated sandbox</li>
<li>Versioning &ndash; we are able to easily version and modify containers, and ship only the changed bits saving bandwidth; essential for large clusters deployed in the cloud</li>
<li>Central repository &ndash; you can build an entire cluster from a trusted and centralised container repository, the Docker Registry/Hub</li>
<li>Smart resource allocation &ndash; containers can be <code>shipped</code> anywhere and resources can be allotted</li>
</ul>


<h2>Cloudbreak &ndash; the project</h2>

<h3>Cloudbreak UI</h3>

<p>The easiest way to start your own Hadoop cluster in your favorite cloud provider is to use our hosted solution. We host, maintain and support <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak</a> for you. Cloudbreak UI is a secure and intuitive way to launch on-demand Hadoop clusters with a few mouse clicks. Please note that Cloudbreak is launching Hadoop clusters on the user&rsquo;s behalf &ndash; on different cloud providers. We do not store your cloud provider account details (such as username, password, keys, private SSL certificates, etc), but work around the concept that Identity and Access Management is fully controlled by you &ndash; the end user.</p>

<h3>Cloudbreak API</h3>

<p>Cloudbreak is a RESTful Hadoop as a Service API. The easiest way to use the API is by using our hosted <a href="http://docs.cloudbreak.apiary.io/">Cloudbreak API</a>.</p>

<p>We have also give you the option to host Cloudbreak within your organization. Once it is deployed in your favourite servlet container exposes a REST API allowing to span up Hadoop clusters of arbitrary sizes on your selected cloud provider. With Cloudbreak you are one POST away from your on-demand Hadoop cluster. You can get the code from our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak">GitHub repository</a>. For further documentation please follow up with the <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">general</a> and <a href="http://docs.cloudbreak.apiary.io/">API</a> documentation, or subscribe to one of our social channels in order to receive notifications about further blog posts and releases.</p>

<h3>Cloudbreak REST client</h3>

<p>In order to ease your work with the REST API and embed in your codebase we have created (and also extensively use) a Groovy REST client. The code is available at our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-rest-client">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

<h3>Cloudbreak CLI</h3>

<p>As we automate everything and we are a very DevOps focused company we are always trying to create easy ways to interact with our systems and API’s. In case of Cloudbreak we have created and released a <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-shell">command line shell</a>, the Cloudbreak CLI. The CLI allows you to use all the REST calls, and it has a large number of easing commands. Interactive help and completion is available.</p>

<h3>Cloudbreak documentation</h3>

<p>We have created two types of documentation. The <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak Product</a> documentation contains an overview, installation, architectural and technical content, whereas the <a href="http://docs.cloudbreak.apiary.io/">Cloudbreak API</a> explains the REST API with examples and a mock server to test your integration.</p>

<h2>Supported Hadoop services</h2>

<p>At high level the supported list of components can be grouped into two main categories: Master and Slave &ndash; and bundling them together form a Hadoop Service. <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak</a> supports the following Hadoop services.</p>

<p><code>

    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/05/docker-debug-with-nsenter-on-boot2docker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>nsenter</code> is a small tool allowing to <code>enter</code> into <code>n</code>ame<code>s</code>paces. Specifically
when you work with docker, it means you can <em>enter</em> any docker container, even
it they don&rsquo;t run any sshd. Running sshd in a docker container for debuging
<a href="http://jpetazzo.github.io/2014/06/23/docker-ssh-considered-evil/">considered evil</a>.</p>

<h2>Nsenter with Boot2docker</h2>

<p>Docker doesn&rsquo;t run directly on OS X and on Windows, so you need
<a href="http://boot2docker.io/">boot2docker</a>. To get <code>nsenter</code> working with boot2docker
is a bit trickier.</p>

<p>For the impatient here is a simple function, which lets you enter any docker
container directly from OS X (or any boot2docker host):</p>

<p><code>
docker-enter() {
  boot2docker ssh '[ -f /var/lib/boot2docker/nsenter ] || docker run --rm -v /var/lib/boot2docker/:/target jpetazzo/nsenter'
  boot2docker ssh -t sudo /var/lib/boot2docker/docker-enter "$@"
}
</code></p>

<p>the first line installs <code>nsenter</code> and <code>docker-enter</code> if missing and the second line
does the actual call.</p>

<p>once you declared the function, you can use it as:</p>

<p><code>
docker-enter &lt;CONTAINER-ID/CONTAINER-NAME&gt;
</code></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>If you are interested about the details how this works read on.</p>

<h2>Install nseneter onto boot2docker</h2>

<p>How to install nsenter into boot2docker? Its a bit tricky, as boot2docker isn&rsquo;t
a full-blown linux, it&rsquo;s based on tiny core linux, so compiling on it is not trivial.</p>

<p>But guess what, <strong>jpetazzo</strong> already created a <a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter">dockerized nsenter</a>
It suggest to install the binary <code>nsenter</code> as:</p>

<p><code>
docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target jpetazzo/nsenter
</code></p>

<p>This works with boot2docker &hellip; until you restart it. You should store all
changes on the persistent <code>/var/lib/boot2docker</code> directory.</p>

<p><code>
docker run --rm -v /var/lib/boot2docker/:/target jpetazzo/nsenter
</code></p>

<h2>the docker-enter script</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter/blob/master/docker-enter">docker-enter</a> is
a helper script to do the following 2 steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>gets the <code>PID</code> of the docker container</li>
<li>executes <code>nsenter</code> optionally passing the name of a program to execute inside
the namespace. if no command is specified a shell will be invoked instead.</li>
</ul>


<p>In the previous step, when you have installed <code>nseneter</code> the <code>docker-enter</code> srcipt
<a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter/blob/master/installer#L6">got installed</a> into the same directory.</p>

<h2>Nsenter directly from OS X</h2>

<p>Some blogs advise you to first ssh into boot2docker, and use nsenter or docker-enter
inside of the virtual env. But if you are executing a single command via ssh, you
can pass the command to the last argument of: <code>boot2docker ssh &lt;COMMAND&gt;</code></p>

<h2>One-liner</h2>

<p>So combine all the steps into a single <strong>one-liner</strong> function:</p>

<p><code>
docker-enter() { boot2docker ssh -t "[ -f /var/lib/boot2docker/nsenter ] || docker run --rm -v /var/lib/boot2docker/:/target jpetazzo/nsenter; sudo /var/lib/boot2docker/docker-enter $@"; }
</code></p>

<p>If you want it permanently either copy-paste it into your <code>~/.profile</code> or
<code>~/.bash_profile</code>. Or save it into <code>/usr/local/bin</code>:</p>

<p><code>
curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/docker-enter j.mp/docker-enter &amp;&amp; . /usr/local/bin/docker-enter
</code></p>

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/06/25/hadoop-2-4-0-docker/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-25T18:07:18+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/06/25/hadoop-2-4-0-docker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago we have released an Apache Hadoop 2.3 Docker image &ndash; in a very short time this become the most <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/search?q=hadoop&amp;s=downloads">popular</a> Hadoop image in the Docker <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/">registry</a>.</p>

<p>Following on the success of our Hadoop 2.3 Docker <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker/">image</a>, the feedbacks and requests we have received and aligning with the Hadoop release cycle, we have released an Apache Hadoop 2.4.1 Docker image &ndash; same as the previous version this is available as a trusted and automated build on the official Docker <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/">registry</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that beside this Hadoop image, we have released and maintain a <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/06/17/ambari-cluster-on-docker/">pseudo-distributed</a> and <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/06/19/multinode-hadoop-cluster-on-docker/">distributed</a> Hadoop Docker image provisioned with Apache Ambari. As they are provisioned with Ambari you have the option to change, add and remove Hadoop components using cluster blueprints.</p>

<h2>Build the image</h2>

<p>In case you&rsquo;d like to try directly from the <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker">Dockerfile</a> you can build the image as:</p>

<p><code>
docker build  -t sequenceiq/hadoop-docker .
</code></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Pull the image</h2>

<p>As it is also released as an official Docker image from Docker&rsquo;s automated build repository &ndash; you can always pull or refer the image when launching containers.</p>

<p><code>
docker pull sequenceiq/hadoop-docker:2.4.1
</code></p>

<h2>Start a container</h2>

<p>In order to use the Docker image you have just build or pulled use:</p>

<p><code>
docker run -i -t sequenceiq/hadoop-docker /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash
</code></p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>You can run one of the stock examples:</p>

<p>```
cd $HADOOP_PREFIX</p>

<h1>run the mapreduce</h1>

<p>bin/hadoop jar share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.4.1.jar grep input output &lsquo;dfs[a-z.]+&rsquo;</p>

<h1>check the output</h1>

<p>bin/hdfs dfs -cat output/*
```</p>

<h2>Hadoop native libraries, build, Bintray, etc</h2>

<p>The Hadoop build process is no easy task &ndash; requires lots of libraries and their right version, protobuf, etc and takes some time &ndash; we have simplified all these, made the build and released a 64b version of Hadoop nativelibs on our <a href="https://bintray.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-bin/hadoop-native-64bit/2.4.1/view/files">Bintray repo</a>. Enjoy.</p>
