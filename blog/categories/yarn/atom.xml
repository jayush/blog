    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With this blog post we are starting a series of articles where we&rsquo;d like to describe how we use YARN, why it is central to our product stack and why we believe that Hortonworks Hoya will be a determining building block in the Hadoop ecosystem.</p>

<p>While we don&rsquo;t want to get in details about <a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/yarn/">YARN</a>, we&rsquo;d like to briefly explain the advantages of running an application on YARN, and introduce you to <a href="https://github.com/hortonworks/hoya">Hortonworks Hoya</a>.</p>

<p>At SequenceIQ we are building a multi-tenant, scale on demand data platform, with unpredictable batch and streaming workloads.
Before YARN we have tried different cluster management frameworks with Hadoop and managed to have pretty good results with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/">Amazon EC2 Autoscaling groups</a>. Being true believers in open source and the need to diversify of provisioning Hadoop on different environments we needed to find an open source and &lsquo;standardised&rsquo; solution &ndash; welcome YARN.
(for example we provision Hadoop on <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/03/19/hadoop-2-dot-3-with-docker/">Docker</a>).</p>

<p>YARN separates the processing engine from the resource management &ndash; and acting effectively as an OS for Hadoop.
With YARN, you can now run multiple applications in Hadoop, all sharing a common resource management and improving cluster utilisation (we will release some metrics soon).
YARN also provides the following features out of the box:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-tenancy</li>
<li>Management and monitoring</li>
<li>High availability</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Failover and recovery</li>
</ul>


<p>All of the above and the effort of the Hadoop community and the wide adoption convinced us to start implementing our platform to run on top of YARN.
During our proof of concepts we went as far as starting all our non Hadoop (and not YARN compatible) applications on YARN &ndash; using <a href="https://github.com/hortonworks/hoya">Hoya</a>.</p>

<p>Hoya was introduced by Hortonworks mid last year &ndash; with the purpose to create Apache HBase clusters on YARN (since than it supports Apache Accumulo as well).
The code evolved pretty fast and now Hoya is a framework/application which allows you to deploy existing distributed applications on YARN &ndash; and benefit all the nice features of YARN.</p>

<p>In order to support different applications Hoya has a plugin provider architecture (supported plugins are in the <em>org.apache.hoya.providers</em> package).
Once a plugin is implemented (pretty straightforward, took us a few days only to understand and build a Flume and Tomcat plugin), the application is started in a YARN container and is monitored and controlled by YARN/Hoya.
The clusters can be started, stopped, frozen and re-sized dynamically &ndash; and in case of container failures Hoya deploys a replacement.</p>

<p>For a better architectural understanding of Hoya please read the following blog <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/hoya-hbase-on-yarn-application-architecture/">post</a>.</p>

<p>In this first post we would like to help you to get familiar with the benefits offered by Hoya and start an HBase cluster, re-scale it dynamically, freeze and stop.
First and foremost you will need an installation of Hadoop (2.3), the latest Hoya release (0.13.1) and HBase (0.98).
For your convenience we have put together an automated install script which lets you start with Hoya in a few minutes.</p>

<p>The script is available from our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/hoya-docker/blob/master/hoya-centos-install.sh">GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>Once Hadoop, HBase and Hoya are installed you can now create an HBase cluster.
``` bash
create-hoya-cluster() {
  hoya create hbase &mdash;role master 1 &mdash;role worker 1</p>

<pre><code>--manager localhost:8032
--filesystem hdfs://localhost:9000 --image hdfs://localhost:9000/hbase.tar.gz
--appconf file:///tmp/hoya-master/hoya-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/hoya/providers/hbase/conf
--zkhosts localhost
</code></pre>

<p>}
```
This will launch a 2 node HBase cluster (1 Master and 1 RegionServer). Now lets increase the number of RegionServers.</p>

<p><code>bash
flex-hoya-cluster() {
  num_of_workers=$1
  hoya flex hbase --role worker $num_of_workers --manager localhost:8032 --filesystem hdfs://localhost:9000
}
</code></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This will start as many RegionServers as specified &ndash; in new YARN containers. Also the size of the cluster can be decreased if the load on the system does not demand for a larger number of RegionServers. The cluster can also be freezed (Hoya takes care about persisting the state).</p>

<p><code>bash
freeze-hoya-cluster() {
  hoya freeze hbase --manager localhost:8032 --filesystem hdfs://localhost:9000
}
</code></p>

<p>Finally when you&rsquo;d like to destroy the cluster and the state associated with the application you can use:</p>

<p><code>bash
destroy-hoya-cluster() {
  hoya destroy hbase --manager localhost:8032 --filesystem hdfs://localhost:9000
}
</code>
As you see installing Hoya and starting different applications (HBase in this case) is very simple &ndash; and all the nice features of YARN are instantly available for any clustered applications.
In our next post we will drive you through the steps of creating your own Hoya provider, deploy it and run on a YARN cluster.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/03/14/yarn-capacity-scheduler/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-14T15:17:04+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/03/14/yarn-capacity-scheduler</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the emergence of Hadoop 2 and the YARN based architecture we have a platform where we can run multiple applications (of different types) not constrained only to MapReduce. Different applications or different MapReduce job profiles have different resource needs, however since Hadoop 2.0 is a multi tenant platform the different users could have different access patterns or need for cluster capacity. In Hadoop 2.0 this is achieved through YARN schedulers — to allocate resources to various applications subject to constraints of capacities and queues (for more information on YARN follow this <a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/yarn/">link</a> or feel free to ask us should you have any questions).</p>

<p>In Hadoop 2.0, the scheduler is a pluggable piece of code that lives inside the <em>ResourceManager</em> (the JobTracker in MR1) &ndash; the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all the applications in the system. The scheduler in YARN does not perform monitoring or status tracking and offers no guarantees to restart failed tasks — check our sample <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/tree/master/yarn-queue-tests">GitHub</a> project to check how monitoring or progress can be tracked.</p>

<p>The Capacity Scheduler was designed to allow significantly higher cluster utilization while still providing predictability for Hadoop workloads, while sharing resources in a predictable and simple manner, using the common notion of <em>job queues</em>.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/tree/master/yarn-queue-tests">example</a> we show you how to use the Capacity Scheduler, configure queues with different priorities, submit MapReduce jobs into these queues, monitor and track the progress of the jobs &ndash; and ultimately see the differences between execution times and throughput of different queue setups.</p>

<p>First, let’s config the Capacity Scheduler (you can use xml, <a href="http://ambari.apache.org/">Apache Ambari</a> or you can configure queues programmatically). In this example we use a simple xml configuration.</p>

<p><code>xml
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.queues&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;default,highPriority,lowPriority&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.highPriority.capacity&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;70&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.lowPriority.capacity&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;20&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.capacity&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;10&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</code>
We have 3 queues, with different queue setups/priorities. Each queue is given a <em>minimum</em> guaranteed percentage of total cluster capacity available &ndash; the total guaranteed capacity must equal 100%. In our example the <em>highPriority</em> queue has 70% of the resources, the <em>lowPriority</em> 20%, and the default queue has the remaining 10%. While it is not highlight in the example above, the Capacity Scheduler provides elastic resource scheduling, which means that if there are idle resources in the cluster, then one queue can take up more of the cluster capacity than was minimally allocated . In our case we could allocate a <em>maximum</em> capacity to the <em>lowPriority</em> queue:</p>

<p><code>xml
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;yarn.scheduler.capacity.root. lowPriority.maximum-capacity&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;50&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</code></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Now lets submit some jobs into these queues. We will use the QuasiMonteCarlo.java example (coming with Hadoop) &ndash; a MapReduce job that estimates the value of Pi, and submit the same MapReduce jobs into the low and high priority queues.</p>

<p>``` java</p>

<pre><code>//get a configuration
Configuration priorityConf = new Configuration();
priorityConf.set("mapreduce.job.queuename", queueName);
………………………     
//submit the job
JobID jobID = QuasiMonteCarlo.submitPiEstimationMRApp(“Pi estimation into: "+ queueName, 10, 3, tempDir, priorityConf);
</code></pre>

<p>```
Once the jobs are submitted in the different queues, you can track the MapReduce job progress and monitor the queues through YARN. Using YARNRunner you can get ahold of a job status, and retrieve different informations:</p>

<p>``` java</p>

<pre><code>//print overall job M/R progresses
LOGGER.info("\nJob " + jobStatus.getJobName() + "in queue (" + jobStatus.getQueue() + ")" + " progress M/R: " +                 jobStatus.getMapProgress() + "/" + jobStatus.getReduceProgress());
LOGGER.info("Tracking URL : " + jobStatus.getTrackingUrl());
LOGGER.info("Reserved memory : " + jobStatus.getReservedMem() + ", used memory : "+ jobStatus.getUsedMem() + " and          used slots : "+ jobStatus.getNumUsedSlots());

// list map &amp; reduce tasks statuses and progress        
TaskReport[] reports = yarnRunner.getTaskReports(jobID, TaskType.MAP);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; reports.length; i++) {
LOGGER.info("MAP: Status " + reports[i].getCurrentStatus() + " with task ID " + reports[i].getTaskID() + ", and                 progress " + reports[i].getProgress()); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Same way the queue capacity can be tracked as well:</p>

<p>```java</p>

<pre><code>ArrayNode queues = (ArrayNode) jsonNode.path("scheduler").path("schedulerInfo").path("queues").get("queue");
for (int i = 0; i &lt; queues.size(); i++) {
JsonNode queueNode = queues.get(i);                     
LOGGER.info("queueName / usedCapacity / absoluteUsedCap / absoluteCapacity / absMaxCapacity: " + 
                    queueNode.findValue("queueName") + " / " +
                    queueNode.findValue("usedCapacity") + " / " + 
                    queueNode.findValue("absoluteUsedCapacity") + " / " + 
                    queueNode.findValue("absoluteCapacity") + " / " +
                    queueNode.findValue("absoluteMaxCapacity"));
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>``
You can run the example with</code>hadoop jar yarn-queue-tests-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.sequenceiq.yarntest.client.JobClient<code>, and play with different queue setups. Once you have changed the queue setup you can refresh the settings with</code>yarn rmadmin -refreshQueues`.</p>

<p>You can check the progress through the <a href="https://gist.github.com/matyix/9528220">logs</a>.The <a href="http://sandbox.hortonworks.com:8088/cluster/scheduler">cluster statistics</a> and <a href="http://sandbox.hortonworks.com:8088/cluster/apps">application statistics</a> are available as well (we run this example on Hortonworks HDP2 sandbox, but any other Hadoop 2 distribution works &ndash; you can set your own cluster on Amazon EC2 using SequenceIQ&rsquo;s setup scripts from our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/hadoop-cloud-scripts">GitHub</a> page).</p>

<p>As you expect, the jobs submitted into the  <code>highPriority</code> queue are finished earlier than those submitted into the <code>lowPriority</code> one &ndash; though (in case of submitting into the same queue) the MapReduce jobs should take the same time (as they are the same MapReduce job, have the same job profile).</p>

<p>This is a good way to start experimenting multi-tenancy and parallel jobs submission into a shared cluster (beyond the Fair Scheduler). At <a href="http://sequenceiq.com">SequenceIQ</a> we are working on a heuristic YARN scheduler &ndash; where we can adapt to increased work loads, submit jobs into queues based on different customer QoS profiles, and increase or downsize our cloud based cluster based on load and capacity.</p>
