    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago we have open sourced our cloud agnostic and Docker based Hadoop as a Service API &ndash; called <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak">Cloudbreak</a>.
The first public beta version supports Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure, while we are already wrapping up a few new cloud provider integrations.</p>

<p>While there is some documentation about running Docker containers on Amazon, there is no detailed description about running Docker on the Azure cloud.
With this blog post we would like to shed some light on it &ndash; recently there have been lots of announcements from Microsoft about Docker support (Azure CLI, Kubernetes, libswarm) but they are either not finished yet or are not ready to build a robust platform on top.
We are eagerly waiting for the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/07/10/azure-collaboration-with-google-and-docker/">Kubernetes integration</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you are interested in running a <code>cluster</code> of Docker container, or do some more complex stuff then read on.</p>

<p>Just to briefly recap &ndash; with Cloudbreak we are launching on demand Hadoop clusters (check our <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/25/cloudbreak-technology/">blog</a> for further technical details) in Docker containers. These containers are <code>shipped</code> to different cloud VMsm and dynamically find and join each other &ndash; they form a fully functional Hadoop cluster without the need to do anything manually on the host, or apply any manual pre-configuration.
So how are we doing this?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Docker ready base VM image</h3>

<p>First of all you need a base image with Docker installed &ndash; thus for that we have built and made available an Ubuntu 14.04 image with Docker installed. Apart from Docker, to build a fully dynamic and <code>service discovery</code> aware Docker cluster we needed <a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/basicnet/bridge-utils.html"> bridge-utils</a>.</p>

<p>Once this base image is created you will need to make it public and re-usable. In order to do that the image has to be published in <a href="http://vmdepot.msopentech.com/List/Index">VMdepot</a>. When you are about to use an image from VM depot, and create a VM based on that you will need to copy it in your own storage account &ndash; note that doing it at first time this can be a slow process (20-25 minutes, copying the 30 GB image).</p>

<h3>Dynamic networking</h3>

<p>Now you have an image based on that you can launch your own VMs, and the Docker container inside your VM. While there are a few options to do that, we needed to find a unified way to do so &ndash; note that  <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak">Cloudbreak</a> is a cloud agnostic solution &ndash; and we do not want to create init scripts for each and every cloud environment we use. Amazon’s AWS has a feature so called <code>userdata</code> &ndash; an option of passing data to the instance that can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. You can pass two types of user data to Amazon AWS: shell scripts and cloud-init directives. In order to keep the launch process unified everywhere we are using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit">cloud-init</a> on Azure as well.</p>

<p>You can use/start Docker with different networking setup &ndash; using a bridged network or using the host network. You can check the init scripts in our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/blob/master/src/main/resources/azure-init.sh">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

<p><strong>Bridged network</strong></p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>set bridge0 in docker opts</h1>

<p>sh -c &ldquo;cat > /etc/default/docker&rdquo; &lt;&lt;&ldquo;EOF&rdquo;
DOCKER_OPTS=&ldquo;-b bridge0 -H unix:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375&rdquo;
EOF</p>

<p>CMD=&ldquo;docker run -d -p SOURCE_PORT:DESTINATION_PORT 0 -e SERF_JOIN_IP=$SERF_JOIN_IP -e SERF_ADVERTISE_IP=$MY_IP &mdash;dns 127.0.0.1 &mdash;name ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX} -h ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX}.${MYDOMAIN} &mdash;entrypoint /usr/local/serf/bin/start-serf-agent.sh  $IMAGE $AMBARI_ROLE&rdquo;</p>

<p>```
<strong>Host network</strong></p>

<p><code>bash
CMD="docker run -d -e SERF_JOIN_IP=$AMBARI_SERVER_IP --net=host --name ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX} --entrypoint /usr/local/serf/bin/start-serf-agent.sh  $IMAGE $AMBARI_ROLE"
</code></p>

<p><em>Note: for cloud based clusters we are giving up on the bridged based network &ndash; mostly due to Azure&rsquo;s networking limitations &ndash; and will use the <code>net=host</code> solution in the next release. The bridged network will still be a supported solution, though we are using it mostly with bare metal or multi container/host solutions.</em></p>

<p>Azure has (comparing with Amazon’s AWS or Google’s Cloud compute) an <code>uncommon</code> network setup and supports limited flexibility &ndash; in order to overcome these, and still have a dynamic Hadoop cluster different scenarios / use cases requires different Docker networking &ndash; that is quite a large <strong>undocumented</strong> topic which we will cover in our next blog posts &ndash; in particular the issues, differences and solutions to use Docker on different cloud providers. While we have briefly talked about <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#technology">Serf</a> in the <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> documentation, we will enter in deep technical details in one of our next posts as well. Should you be interested in these, make sure you follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sequenceiq/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sequenceiq">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook">Facebook</a> for updates.</p>

<h3>SequenceIQ’s Azure REST API &ndash; open sourced</h3>

<p>At <a href="htp://sequenceiq.com">SequenceIQ</a> we always automate everything &ndash; and in order to launch VM instances, configure networks, start containers, etc we needed a REST client which we can use it from our JAVA and Scala codebase. Since the Microsoft API is XML based &ndash; <em>yo, it’s 2014</em> &ndash; we have created and open sourced a Groovy based <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/azure-rest-client">Azure REST API</a> &ndash; wrapping the XML calls into a nice, easy to use and clean REST API. Feel free to use it &ndash; it’s open sourced under an Apache 2 license. Note that <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> does not store your Azure user credential &ndash; whereas with the defulat Azue CLI that would have been possible &ndash; the only thing we need from your side to work is your subscription id. The process is documented here: <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#accounts.">http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#accounts.</a></p>

<h3>Metadata service for Azure</h3>

<p>The another nice feature we have created for Azure VMs is a <code>metadata service</code>. While a service as such does exists on Amazon’s AWS it’s missing from Microsoft Azure &ndash; note that our Cloudbreak solution is a cloud agnostic one, and we always strive to use identical solution on all cloud providers. The instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instances &ndash; and available via a REST call. We have developed a service as such for Azure &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/service/stack/connector/azure/AzureMetadataSetup.java">AzureMetadataSetup</a>. As you can see we collect the metadata, and make it available under a <code>unique hash</code> for each cluster by calling the following resource: <code>/metadata/{hash}</code></p>

<p>```java
private Set<CoreInstanceMetaData> collectMetaData(Stack stack, AzureClient azureClient, String name) {</p>

<pre><code>... try {
            CoreInstanceMetaData instanceMetaData = new CoreInstanceMetaData(vmName,
                    getPrivateIP((String) virtualMachine),
                    getVirtualIP((String) virtualMachine));
            instanceMetaDatas.add(instanceMetaData);
        } catch (IOException e) { ...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```
This service is used in a few cases &ndash; for example to learn different network setups as the hosts are using different network options than the Docker containers.</p>

<p>As usual for us &ndash; being committed to 100% open source &ndash; we are always open sourcing everything thus you can get the details on our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak">GitHub</a> repository.

    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/18/announcing-cloudbreak</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Cloudbreak is a powerful left surf that breaks over a coral reef, a mile off southwest the island of Tavarua, Fiji.</em></p>

<p><em>Cloudbreak is a cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API. Abstracts the provisioning and ease management and monitoring of on-demand clusters.</em></p>

<p>Today is a big day for us and the Hadoop community &ndash; we are announcing the first <code>public beta</code> version of our open source and cloud agnostic <strong>Hadoop as a Service API</strong>.</p>

<p>During our daily work with large Hadoop clusters in the cloud, <code>dockerized</code> environments and bare metal we were doing the same things over and over again. Although we are automating and <code>dockerizing</code> always everything, we felt that something is missing &ndash; an open source, cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API. Welcome <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> &ndash; you are one POST away from your on-demand Hadoop cluster on your favorite cloud provider.</p>

<p>When we have started to work on Cloudbreak &ndash; first of all to solve our internal needs at SequenceIQ &ndash; we have set the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use open source software and be <strong>100% open source</strong> under Apache 2 license</li>
<li>Have the ability to quickly launch arbitrary sized Hadoop clusters</li>
<li>Be cloud provider agnostic and create an SDK which allows to quickly add new providers</li>
<li>No more glue code, repeating the same things over and over again</li>
<li>Have a REST API and a CLI in order to be able to automate the whole process</li>
<li>Create an easy to use and responsive UI</li>
<li>Support different Hadoop services and configurations in a declarative way</li>
<li>Elastic and flexible, with the ability to resize running clusters</li>
<li>Secure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Docker in the cloud</h2>

<p>At <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/">SequenceIQ</a> we are running all our core applications and processes in Docker containers &ndash; and that is true for Hadoop and all of the services as well. During the last few months we have <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/06/19/multinode-hadoop-cluster-on-docker/">blogged</a> and open sourced all of the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/">building blocks</a> of our <code>dockerized</code> systems and <strong>Cloudbreak</strong> is built on the foundation of these and reusing the same technologies we have released before. While Cloudbreak&rsquo;s primary role is to launch on-demand Hadoop clusters in the cloud, the underlying technology actually does more. It can launch on-demand Hadoop clusters in any environment which supports Docker &ndash; in a dynamic way. There is no predefined configuration needed as all the setup, orchestration, networking and cluster membership is done dynamically.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/">Docker containers</a> &ndash; all the Hadoop services are installed and running inside Docker containers, and these containers are <code>shipped</code>  between different cloud vendors, keeping Cloudbreak cloud agnostic</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/ambari-rest-client">Apache Ambari</a> &ndash; to declaratively define a Hadoop cluster</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/docker-serf">Serf</a> &ndash; for cluster membership, failure detection, and orchestration that is decentralized, fault-tolerant and highly available for dynamic clusters</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/docker-dnsmasq">dnsmasq</a> &ndash; to provide resolvable fully qualified domain names between dynamically created Docker containers.</li>
</ul>


<p>The project was presented at the <strong>Hadoop Summit 2014,</strong> in San Jose &ndash; you can get the slides from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JanosMatyas/docker-based-hadoop-provisioning">here</a>.</p>

<p>While there is an extensive list of articles explaining the benefits of using Docker, we would like to highlight our motivations in a few bullet points.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write once, run anywhere &ndash; our solution uses the same Docker containers on different cloud providers, <code>dockerized</code>  environments or bare metal, no difference at all</li>
<li>Reproducible, testable environment &ndash; we are recreating complete config environments in seconds, and being able to work with the same containers on our laptop, QA and production/cloud environments</li>
<li>Isolation &ndash; each container is separated and runs in its own isolated sandbox</li>
<li>Versioning &ndash; we are able to easily version and modify containers, and ship only the changed bits saving bandwidth; essential for large clusters deployed in the cloud</li>
<li>Central repository &ndash; you can build an entire cluster from a trusted and centralised container repository, the Docker Registry/Hub</li>
<li>Smart resource allocation &ndash; containers can be <code>shipped</code> anywhere and resources can be allotted</li>
</ul>


<h2>Cloudbreak &ndash; the project</h2>

<h3>Cloudbreak UI</h3>

<p>The easiest way to start your own Hadoop cluster in your favorite cloud provider is to use our hosted solution. We host, maintain and support <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak</a> for you. Cloudbreak UI is a secure and intuitive way to launch on-demand Hadoop clusters with a few mouse clicks. Please note that Cloudbreak is launching Hadoop clusters on the user&rsquo;s behalf &ndash; on different cloud providers. We do not store your cloud provider account details (such as username, password, keys, private SSL certificates, etc), but work around the concept that Identity and Access Management is fully controlled by you &ndash; the end user.</p>

<h3>Cloudbreak API</h3>

<p>Cloudbreak is a RESTful Hadoop as a Service API. The easiest way to use the API is by using our hosted <a href="http://docs.cloudbreak.apiary.io/">Cloudbreak API</a>.</p>

<p>We have also give you the option to host Cloudbreak within your organization. Once it is deployed in your favourite servlet container exposes a REST API allowing to span up Hadoop clusters of arbitrary sizes on your selected cloud provider. With Cloudbreak you are one POST away from your on-demand Hadoop cluster. You can get the code from our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak">GitHub repository</a>. For further documentation please follow up with the <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">general</a> and <a href="http://docs.cloudbreak.apiary.io/">API</a> documentation, or subscribe to one of our social channels in order to receive notifications about further blog posts and releases.</p>

<h3>Cloudbreak REST client</h3>

<p>In order to ease your work with the REST API and embed in your codebase we have created (and also extensively use) a Groovy REST client. The code is available at our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-rest-client">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

<h3>Cloudbreak CLI</h3>

<p>As we automate everything and we are a very DevOps focused company we are always trying to create easy ways to interact with our systems and API’s. In case of Cloudbreak we have created and released a <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-shell">command line shell</a>, the Cloudbreak CLI. The CLI allows you to use all the REST calls, and it has a large number of easing commands. Interactive help and completion is available.</p>

<h3>Cloudbreak documentation</h3>

<p>We have created two types of documentation. The <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak Product</a> documentation contains an overview, installation, architectural and technical content, whereas the <a href="http://docs.cloudbreak.apiary.io/">Cloudbreak API</a> explains the REST API with examples and a mock server to test your integration.</p>

<h2>Supported Hadoop services</h2>

<p>At high level the supported list of components can be grouped into two main categories: Master and Slave &ndash; and bundling them together form a Hadoop Service. <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak</a> supports the following Hadoop services.</p>
