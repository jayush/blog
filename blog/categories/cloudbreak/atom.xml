    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/16/fairplay</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently we’ve been asked an interesting question &ndash; how fair is the YARN <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/FairScheduler.html">FairScheduler</a> &ndash; while we never use internally the fair scheduler after a quick test the short answer is &ndash; <strong>very fair</strong>.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/">SequenceIQ</a> we always use the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html">CapacityScheduler</a> &ndash; actually an enhanced version of it (coming with the 2.6.0 release of Hadoop). Since the emergence of YARN and the new schedulers we were working on a solution to bring SLA to Hadoop &ndash; and part of this work was our contribution to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1495">Apache YARN schedulers</a> and <a href="http://ambari.apache.org/">Apache Ambari</a>. Anyway, we decided to configure a FairScheduler in one of our 20 node test cluster and run a quick test.</p>

<h3>Fair scheduler</h3>

<p>Remember than before YARN only one resource represented a resource on a cluster &ndash; the <code>slot</code>. Every node had slots, and your MR job was taking up slots , regardless of their actual resource usage (CPU, memory). It worked but for sure it wasn’t a fair game &ndash; and caused lots of frustration between administrators of applications competing for <code>slots</code>. We have seen many over and undersubscribed nodes in terms of CPU and memory. YARN introduced the concept of containers and the ability to request/attach resources to them (vCores and memory).</p>

<p>While this seams already a big step forward comparing with slots, it brought up other problems &ndash; with multiple resources as <code>vCores</code> and <code>memory</code> and <code>disk</code> and <code>network i/o</code> in the future it’s pretty challenging to share them fairly. With a single resource it would we pretty straightforward &ndash; nevertheless the community based on a <a href="http://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi11/tech/full_papers/Ghodsi.pdf">research paper</a> coming out from UC Berkeley (Ghodsi et al) managed to get this working through (again a community effort) this <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-326">YARN ticket</a>.</p>

<p>Now let’s battle test how fair is the scheduler when running two MR application with changing resource usage &ndash; how well the dominant resource fairness works.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>The test</h3>

<p>We decided to take a pretty easy MR job with 64 input files. In order to bring in some  variables, the input files are a multiple of 4MB, distributed as the smallest is 4MB and the largest is 256MB. The used <code>block size</code> is 256MB, and the number of nodes in the cluster is <strong>20</strong>. We are using and open sourced an <strong>R based</strong> <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/yarn-monitoring">YARN monitoring</a> project &ndash; feel free to use it and let us know if you have any feedback.</p>

<p>We were running two jobs &ndash; and the task&rsquo;s input was descending e.g. <em>task_1398345200850_0079_m_000001</em> has a 252MB input file and <em>task_1398345200850_0079_m_000063</em> has a 4MB input. Obliviously the tasks were not necessarily executed in this order, because the order depends on when the nodemanager asks for task.</p>

<p>See the <code>timeboxed</code> result of the two runs.</p>

<p><strong>Run 61</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/yarn-monitoring-R/images/run61.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Run 62</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/yarn-monitoring-R/images/run62.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While the <code>timeboxed</code> version will not really help to decide the resource usage and the elapsed time (which should be pretty much equal) it’s good to show the time spent on different nodes. Many times generating these charts helped us to identify hardware or other software/configuration issues on different nodes (for example when a run execution is outside of the standard deviation). You can use our R project and file to generate charts as such with the help of <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/yarn-monitoring/blob/master/RProjects/TimeBoxes.R">TimeBoxes.R</a> file.</p>

<p>Now if we compare the two execution files and place it on the same chart we will actually see that the FairScheduler is <strong>fairly Fair</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/yarn-monitoring-R/images/test8_active_mapppers_num.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3>Random ideas</h3>

<p>While the purpose of these tests was to show that the fair scheduler distributes resources in a fair way &ndash; sorry I can’t help &ndash; we can see that the executions of the map tasks are not optimal, but at least stable. Also we can notice that the execution order depends also on the blocks locations; if you should know/consider the blocks location ahead the execution could be more optimal.</p>

<p>Measured a few other things as well &ndash; will discuss this on a different post &ndash; and from those charts you can see that the elapsed time of a task grow even as there are free slots.  Also as the number of mappers come closer to the available free slots of the cluster the average elapsed times of the tasks grow &ndash; due to different reasons (which we will share on a forthcoming post).</p>

<p>Since we are not really using the <strong>FairScheduler</strong> and we had one now configured we decided to run a few of our performance tests as well, and while submitting jobs like <code>crazy</code> using the fair scheduler we managed to <code>logjam</code> the cluster.
We have never seen this before while using the <strong>CapacityScheduler</strong> &ndash; and digging into details we figured that the FairScheduler is missing the <code>yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-am-resource-percent</code> property. This <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1913">issue</a> appears to be a bug in the FairScheduler &ndash; fixed in the 2.5 release.</p>

<p>While we don’t want to make any comparison between the two schedulers I think that the FairScheduler is a very viable and good option for those having a cluster and doesn’t want to bother with <strong>capacity planning ahead</strong>. Also I was impressed by the fine grain rules which you can use with the FairScheduler while deciding on the resource allocations.</p>

<p>Note that we are working and open sourcing a project which brings SLA to Hadoop and allows auto-scaling using <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a> &ndash; our open source, cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API. The project is called <strong>Periscope</strong> and will be open sourced very soon.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Docker intercontainer networking explained]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/12/docker-networking/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-12T08:53:15+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/12/docker-networking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this blog entry is to cover advanced topics regarding Docker networking and explain different concepts to inter-connect Docker containers when the containers are running on different host machines.
For the demonstration we are using VMs on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> launched with <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, but the explained networking concepts work also on Amazon EC2 (with VPC) and Azure unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>To set up the the test environment clone the <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples">SequenceIQ&rsquo;s samples repository</a> and follow the instructions.</p>

<p><code>
git clone git@github.com:sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples.git
cd sequenceiq-samples/docker-networking
vagrant up
</code></p>

<p>The <code>vagrant up</code> command launches the test setup, which conatins two Ubuntu 14.04 VMs with the network configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_nat">NAT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/private_network.html">Private networking</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The NAT (related to eth0 interface on VMs) is used only for access the external network from VMs e.g. download files from debian repository, but it is not used for inter-container communication. The Vagrant sets up a properly configured Host Only Networking in VirtualBox therefore the VMs can communicate with each other on the defined IP addresses:</p>

<ul>
<li>vm1: 192.168.40.11</li>
<li>vm2: 192.168.40.12</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see how Docker containers running on these VMs can send IP packets to each other.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Setting up bridge0</h2>

<p>The Docker attaches all containers to the virtual subnet implemented by docker0, this means that by default on both VMs the Docker containers will be launched with IP addresses from range 172.17.42.1/24. This is a problem for some of the solutions explained below, because if the containers on different hosts have the same IP addresses then we won&rsquo;t be able to properly route the IP packets between them. Therefore on each VMs a network bridge is created with the following subnets:</p>

<ul>
<li>vm1: 172.17.51.1/24</li>
<li>vm2: 172.17.52.1/24</li>
</ul>


<p>This means that every container luanched on vm1 will get an IP address from range 172.17.51.2 &ndash; 172.17.51.255 and containers on vm2 will have an address from range 172.17.52.2 &ndash; 172.17.52.255.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>do not execute, it was already executed on vm1 as root during provision from Vagrant</h1>

<p>brctl addbr bridge0
sudo ifconfig bridge0 172.17.51.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
sudo bash -c &lsquo;echo DOCKER_OPTS=\&ldquo;-b=bridge0\&rdquo; >> /etc/default/docker&rsquo;
sudo service docker restart</p>

<h1>do not execute, it was already executed on vm1 as root during provision from Vagrant</h1>

<p>sudo brctl addbr bridge0
sudo ifconfig bridge0 172.17.52.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
sudo bash -c &lsquo;echo DOCKER_OPTS=\&ldquo;-b=bridge0\&rdquo; >> /etc/default/docker&rsquo;
sudo service docker restart
```</p>

<p>As noted in the comments the above configuration is already executed during the provisioning of VMs and it was copied here just for the sake of clarity and completeness.</p>

<h2>Expose container ports to host</h2>

<p>Probably the simplest way to solve inter-container communication is to expose ports from container to the host. This can be done with the <code>-p</code> switch. E.g. exposing the port 3333 is as simple as:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1 -p 3333:3333 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -l 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -w 1 -v 192.168.40.11 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 192.168.40.11 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>This might be well suited for cases when the communication ports are defined in advance (e.g. MySQL will run on port 3306), but will not work when the application uses dynamic ports for communication (like Hadoop does with IPC ports).</p>

<h2>Host networking</h2>

<p>If the container is started with <code>--net=host</code> then it avoids placing the container inside of a separate network stack, but as the Docker documentation says this option &ldquo;tells Docker to not containerize the container&rsquo;s networking&rdquo;. The <code>cont1</code> container can bind directly to the network interface of host therefore the <code>nc</code> will be available directly on 192.168.40.11.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1 &mdash;net=host ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -l 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -w 1 -v 192.168.40.11 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 192.168.40.11 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Of course if you want to access cont2 from cont1 then cont2 also needs to be started with <code>--net=host</code> option.
The host networking is very powerful solution for inter-container communication, but it has its drawbacks, since the ports used by the container can collide with the ports used by host or other containers utilising &mdash;net=host option, because all of them are sharing the same network stack.</p>

<h2>Direct Routing</h2>

<p>So far we have seen methods where the containers have used the IP address of host to communicate with each other, but there are solutions to inter-connect the containers by using their own IPs. If we are using the containers own IPs for routing then it is important that we shall be able to distinguish based on IP which container is running on vm1 and which one is running on on vm2, this was the reason why the bridge0 interface was created as explained in &ldquo;Setting up bridge0&rdquo; section.
To make the things a bit easier to understand I have created a simplified diagram of the network interfaces in our current test setup. If I would like to oversimplify the thing then I would say that, we shall setup the routing in that way that the packets from one container are following the red lines shown on the diagram.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class="<a" src="href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/routing.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/routing.png</a>"></p>

<p>To achive this we need to configure the routing table on hosts in that way that every packet which destination is 172.17.51.0/24 is forwarded to vm1 and every IP packet where the destination is 172.17.52.0/24 is forwarded to vm2. To repeat it shortly, the containers running on vm1 are placed to subnet 172.17.51.0/24, containers on vm2 are on subnet 172.17.52.0/24.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.40.12
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0  netmask 255.255.255.0  gw 192.168.40.11
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>route add</code> command adds the desired routing to the route table, but you might wonder why the iptables configuration is necessary. The reason for that the Docker by default sets up a rule to the nat table to masquerade all IP packets that are leaving the machine. In our case we definitely don&rsquo;t want this, therefore we delete all MASQUERADE rules with -F option. At this point we already would be able to make the connection from one container to other and vice verse, but the containers would not be able to communicate with the outside world, therefore an iptables rule needs to be added to masquerade the packets that are going outside of 172.17.0.0/16. I need to mention the another approach would be to use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/articles/networking/#between-containers">&mdash;iptables=false</a> option of the daemon to avoid any manipulation in the iptables and you can do all the config manually.</p>

<p>Such kind of direct routing from one vm to other vm works great and easy to set up, but cannot be used if the hosts are not on the same subnet. If the host are located the on different subnet the tunneling might be an option as you will see it in the next section.</p>

<p><em>Note: This solution works on Amazon EC2 instances only if the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html#EIP_Disable_SrcDestCheck">Source/Destionation Check</a> is disabled.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: Due to the packet filtering policy of Azure this method cannot be used there.</em></p>

<h2>Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel</h2>

<p>GRE is a tunneling protocol that can encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links.
The main idea is to create a GRE tunnel between the VMs and send all traffic through it:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class="<a" src="href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/gre.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/gre.png</a>"></p>

<p>In order to create a tunnel you need to specify the name, the type (which is gre in our case) and the IP address of local and the remote end. Consequently the tun2 name used for the tunnel on on vm1 since from vm1 perspective that is the tunnel endpoint which leads to vm2 and every packet sent to tun2 to will eventually come out on vm2 end.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>GRE tunnel config execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo iptunnel add tun2 mode gre local 192.168.40.11 remote 192.168.40.12
sudo ifconfig tun2 10.0.201.1
sudo ifconfig tun2 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun2
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>GRE tunnel config execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo iptunnel add tun1 mode gre local 192.168.40.12 remote 192.168.40.11
sudo ifconfig tun1 10.0.202.1
sudo ifconfig tun1 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun1
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>After the tunnel is set up and activated the remaining commands are very similar to the commands executed in the &ldquo;Direct Routing&rdquo; section. The main difference here is that we do not route the traffic directly to other vm, but we are routing it into <code>dev tun1</code> and <code>dev tun2</code> respectively.</p>

<p>With GRE tunnels a point-to-point connection is set up between two hosts, which means that if you have more then two hosts in your network and want to interconnect all of them, then n-1 tunnel endpoint needs to be created on every host, which will be quite challenging to maintain if you have a large cluster.</p>

<p><em>Note: GRE packets are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn133803.aspx">filtered out</a> on Azure therefore this solution cannot be used there.</em></p>

<h2>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h2>

<p>If more secured connections is required between containers then VPNs can be used on VMs. This addiotional security might significantly increase processing overhead. This overhead is highly depends on which VPN solution are you going to use. In this demo we use the VPN capabilities of SSH which is not really suited for production use. In order to enable the VPN capabilites of ssh the  PermitTunnel parameter needs to be switched on in sshd_config. If you are using the Vagranfile provided to this tutorial then nothing needs to be done, since this parameter was already set up for you during provisioning in the bootstrap.sh.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo ssh -f -N -w 2:1 <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x72;&#x6f;&#111;&#x74;&#x40;&#x31;&#x39;&#x32;&#x2e;&#x31;&#x36;&#56;&#46;&#x34;&#48;&#x2e;&#49;&#x32;">&#114;&#x6f;&#x6f;&#116;&#64;&#49;&#x39;&#x32;&#x2e;&#49;&#54;&#x38;&#46;&#x34;&#x30;&#46;&#x31;&#50;</a>
sudo ifconfig tun2 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun2
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo ifconfig tun1 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun1
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The ssh is launched with -w option where the numerical ids of tun devices were specified. After executing the command the tunnel interfaces are created on both VMs. The interfaces needs to be be activated with ifconfig up and after that we need to setup the rooting to direct the traffic to  172.17.51.0/24 and 172.17.52.0/24 to tun2 and tun1.</p>

<p>As mentioned the VPN capabilities of SSH is not recommended in production, but other solutions like  <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html">OpenVPN</a> would worth a try to secure the communication between the hosts (and also between the containers).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The above examples were hand written mainly for demonstration purposes, but there are great tools like <a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework">Pipework</a> that can make your life simpler and will do the heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p>If you want to check how these methods are working in production environment you are just a few clicks from it, since under the hood these methods are responsible to solve the inter-container communication in our cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API called <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a>.</p>

    <updated>2014-08-07T19:43:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/07/clodubreak-shell</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Few weeks back we have announced <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/18/announcing-cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a> &ndash; the open source Hadoop as a Service API. Included in the release we open sourced a REST API, REST client, UI and a CLI/shell. In this post we’d like to show you how easy is to use <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-shell">Cloudbreak shell</a> in order to create on demand Hadoop clusters on your favorite cloud provider.</p>

<p>While it’s up to everybody&rsquo;s personal preference whether to use a UI, a command line interface or the REST API directly, at SequenceIQ we prefer to use command line tools whenever it’s possible because it’s much faster than interacting with a web UI and it’s a better candidate for automation. Yeah &ndash; we have mentioned this many times &ndash; we are <code>obsessed with automation</code>; any step which is a candidate of doing it twice we script and automate it.</p>

<p>This <code>thing</code> with the automation does not affect the effort and quality standards we put on building the UI &ndash; <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak</a> has an extremely intuitive and clean <strong>responsive</strong> UI and it’s built on the latest and greatest web UI framework &ndash; <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a>. We will have a post about the UI, however we consider it so simple to use that we ask you to go ahead and give it a try. You are a signup and a few clicks away from your Hadoop cluster.</p>

<p>Now back to the CLI. Remember one of our Apache contribution &ndash; the <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/05/26/ambari-shell/">Ambari shell and REST API</a>? Well, the Cloudbreak shell is built on the same technology &ndash; Spring Shell. It’s an interactive shell that can be easily extended using a Spring based programming model and battle tested in various projects like Spring Roo, Spring XD, and Spring REST Shell Combine these two projects to create a powerful tool.</p>

<h2>Cloudbreak Shell</h2>

<p>The goal with the CLI was to provide an interactive command line tool which supports:</p>

<ul>
<li>all functionality available through the REST API or Cloudbreak web UI</li>
<li>makes possible complete automation of management task via <strong>scripts</strong></li>
<li>context aware command availability</li>
<li>tab completion</li>
<li>required/optional parameter support</li>
<li><strong>hint</strong> command to guide you on the usual path</li>
</ul>


<h2>Install Cloudbreak Shell</h2>

<p>You have 3 options to give it a try:</p>

<ul>
<li>use our prepared <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/">docker image</a></li>
<li>download the latest self-containing executable jar form our maven repo</li>
<li>build it from source</li>
</ul>


<p>We will follow up with the first two, in this post we’d like to guide you through the third option.</p>

<h3>Build from source</h3>

<p>If want to use the code or extend it with new commands follow the steps below. You will need:
&ndash; jdk 1.7
&ndash; maven 3.x.x</p>

<p><code>
git clone https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-shell.git
cd cloudbreak-shell
mvn clean package
</code></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Connect to Cloudbreak</h2>

<p>In order to use the shell you will have to have a Cloudbreak account. You can get one by subscribing to our hosted and free <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak</a> instance. Alternatively you can build your own Cloudbreak and deploy it within your organization &ndash; for that just follow up with the steps in the Cloudbreak <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#quickstart-and-installation">documentation</a>. We suggest to try our hosted solution as in case you have any issues we can always help you with. Please feel free to create bugs, ask for enhancements or just give us feedback by either using our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak">GitHub repository</a> or the other channels highlighted in the product documentation (Google Groups, email or social channels).
The shell is built as a single executable jar with the help of <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a>.</p>

<p>```
Usage:
  java -jar cloudbreak-shell-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar                  : Starts Cloudbreak Shell in interactive mode.
  java -jar cloudbreak-shell-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &mdash;cmdfile=<FILE> : Cloudbreak executes commands read from the file.</p>

<p>Options:
  &mdash;cloudbreak.host=<HOSTNAME>       Hostname of the Cloudbreak REST API Server [use:cloudbreak-api.sequenceiq.com].
  &mdash;cloudbreak.port=<PORT>           Port of the Cloudbreak REST API Server [use:80].
  &mdash;cloudbreak.user=<USER>           Username of the Cloudbreak user [use:your user name ].
  &mdash;cloudbreak.password=<PASSWORD>   Password of the Cloudbreak admin [use: your password].</p>

<p>Note:
  All options are mandatory.
<code>``
Once you are connected you can start to create a cluster. If you are lost and need guidance through the process you can use</code>hint<code>. You can always use</code>TAB<code>for completion. Note that all commands are</code>context aware` &ndash; they are available only when it makes sense &ndash; this way you are never confused and guided by the system on the right path.</p>

<h3>Create a cloud credential</h3>

<p>In order to start using Cloudbreak you will need to have a cloud user, for example an Amazon AWS account. Note that Cloudbreak <strong>does not</strong> store you cloud user details &ndash; we work around the concept of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">IAM</a> &ndash; on Amazon (or other cloud providers) you will have to create an IAM role, a policy and associate that with your Cloudbreak account &ndash; for further documentation please refer to the <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#accounts">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><code>
credential createEC2 --description “description" --name “myCredentialName" --roleArn "arn:aws:iam::NUMBER:role/cloudbreak-ABC" --sshKeyUrl “URL towards your AWS public key"
</code></p>

<p>Alternatively you can upload your public key from a file as well, by using the <code>—sshKeyPath</code> switch. You can check whether the credential was creates successfully by using the <code>credential list</code> command. You can switch between your cloud credential &ndash; when you’d like to use one and act with that you will have to use:</p>

<p><code>
credential select --id #ID of the credential
</code></p>

<h3>Create a template</h3>

<p>A template gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of cloud infrastructure related resources, maintaining and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion. A template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a new stack).</p>

<p><code>
template createEC2 --description "awstemplate" --name "awstemplate" --region EU_WEST_1 --instanceType M3Large --sshLocation 0.0.0.0/0
</code>
You can check whether the template was created successfully by using the <code>template list</code> command. Check the template with or select if you are happy with:</p>

<p>```
template show &mdash;id #ID of the template</p>

<p>template select &mdash;id #ID of the template
```</p>

<h3>Create a stack</h3>

<p>Stacks are template <code>instances</code> &ndash; a running cloud infrastructure created based on a template. Use the following command to create a stack to be used with your Hadoop cluster:</p>

<p><code>
stack create --name “myStackName" --nodeCount 20
</code></p>

<h3>Select a blueprint</h3>

<p>We ship default Hadoop cluster blueprints with Cloudbreak. You can use these blueprints or add yours. To see the available blueprints and use one of them please use:</p>

<p>```
blueprint list</p>

<p>blueprint select &mdash;id #ID of the blueprint
```</p>

<h3>Create a Hadoop cluster</h3>

<p>You are almost done &ndash; one more command and this will create your Hadoop cluster on your favorite cloud provider. Same as the API, or UI this will use your <code>template</code>, and by using CloudFormation will launch a cloud <code>stack</code> &ndash; once the <code>stack</code> is up and running (cloud provisioning is done) it will use your selected <code>blueprint</code> and install your custom Hadoop cluster with the selected components and services. For the supported list of Hadoop components and services please check the <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#supported-components">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><code>
cluster create --description “my cluster desc"
</code>
You are done &ndash; you can check the progress through the Ambari UI. If you log back to <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak UI</a> you can check the progress over there as well, and learn the IP address of Ambari.</p>

<h3>Automate the process</h3>

<p>Each time you start the shell the executed commands are logged in a file line by line and later either with the <code>script</code> command or specifying an <code>—cmdfile</code> option the same commands can be executed again.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>For the full list of available commands please check below. Please note that all commands are context aware, and you can always use <code>TAB</code> for command completion.</p>

<pre><code>* blueprint add - Add a new blueprint with either --url or --file
* blueprint defaults - Adds the default blueprints to Cloudbreak
* blueprint list - Shows the currently available blueprints
* blueprint select - Select the blueprint by its id

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/04/launch-docker-containers-on-azure/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-04T19:43:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/04/launch-docker-containers-on-azure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago we have open sourced our cloud agnostic and Docker based Hadoop as a Service API &ndash; called <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak">Cloudbreak</a>.
The first public beta version supports Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure, while we are already wrapping up a few new cloud provider integrations.</p>

<p>While there is some documentation about running Docker containers on Amazon, there is no detailed description about running Docker on the Azure cloud.
With this blog post we would like to shed some light on it &ndash; recently there have been lots of announcements from Microsoft about Docker support (Azure CLI, Kubernetes, libswarm) but they are either not finished yet or are not ready to build a robust platform on top.
We are eagerly waiting for the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/07/10/azure-collaboration-with-google-and-docker/">Kubernetes integration</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you are interested in running a <code>cluster</code> of Docker container, or do some more complex stuff then read on.</p>

<p>Just to briefly recap &ndash; with Cloudbreak we are launching on demand Hadoop clusters (check our <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/25/cloudbreak-technology/">blog</a> for further technical details) in Docker containers. These containers are <code>shipped</code> to different cloud VMsm and dynamically find and join each other &ndash; they form a fully functional Hadoop cluster without the need to do anything manually on the host, or apply any manual pre-configuration.
So how are we doing this?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Docker ready base VM image</h3>

<p>First of all you need a base image with Docker installed &ndash; thus for that we have built and made available an Ubuntu 14.04 image with Docker installed. Apart from Docker, to build a fully dynamic and <code>service discovery</code> aware Docker cluster we needed <a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/basicnet/bridge-utils.html"> bridge-utils</a>.</p>

<p>Once this base image is created you will need to make it public and re-usable. In order to do that the image has to be published in <a href="http://vmdepot.msopentech.com/List/Index">VMdepot</a>. When you are about to use an image from VM depot, and create a VM based on that you will need to copy it in your own storage account &ndash; note that doing it at first time this can be a slow process (20-25 minutes, copying the 30 GB image).</p>

<h3>Dynamic networking</h3>

<p>Now you have an image based on that you can launch your own VMs, and the Docker container inside your VM. While there are a few options to do that, we needed to find a unified way to do so &ndash; note that  <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak">Cloudbreak</a> is a cloud agnostic solution &ndash; and we do not want to create init scripts for each and every cloud environment we use. Amazon’s AWS has a feature so called <code>userdata</code> &ndash; an option of passing data to the instance that can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. You can pass two types of user data to Amazon AWS: shell scripts and cloud-init directives. In order to keep the launch process unified everywhere we are using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit">cloud-init</a> on Azure as well.</p>

<p>You can use/start Docker with different networking setup &ndash; using a bridged network or using the host network. You can check the init scripts in our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/blob/master/src/main/resources/azure-init.sh">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

<p><strong>Bridged network</strong></p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>set bridge0 in docker opts</h1>

<p>sh -c &ldquo;cat > /etc/default/docker&rdquo; &lt;&lt;&ldquo;EOF&rdquo;
DOCKER_OPTS=&ldquo;-b bridge0 -H unix:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375&rdquo;
EOF</p>

<p>CMD=&ldquo;docker run -d -p SOURCE_PORT:DESTINATION_PORT 0 -e SERF_JOIN_IP=$SERF_JOIN_IP -e SERF_ADVERTISE_IP=$MY_IP &mdash;dns 127.0.0.1 &mdash;name ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX} -h ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX}.${MYDOMAIN} &mdash;entrypoint /usr/local/serf/bin/start-serf-agent.sh  $IMAGE $AMBARI_ROLE&rdquo;</p>

<p>```
<strong>Host network</strong></p>

<p><code>bash
CMD="docker run -d -e SERF_JOIN_IP=$AMBARI_SERVER_IP --net=host --name ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX} --entrypoint /usr/local/serf/bin/start-serf-agent.sh  $IMAGE $AMBARI_ROLE"
</code></p>

<p><em>Note: for cloud based clusters we are giving up on the bridged based network &ndash; mostly due to Azure&rsquo;s networking limitations &ndash; and will use the <code>net=host</code> solution in the next release. The bridged network will still be a supported solution, though we are using it mostly with bare metal or multi container/host solutions.</em></p>

<p>Azure has (comparing with Amazon’s AWS or Google’s Cloud compute) an <code>uncommon</code> network setup and supports limited flexibility &ndash; in order to overcome these, and still have a dynamic Hadoop cluster different scenarios / use cases requires different Docker networking &ndash; that is quite a large <strong>undocumented</strong> topic which we will cover in our next blog posts &ndash; in particular the issues, differences and solutions to use Docker on different cloud providers. While we have briefly talked about <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#technology">Serf</a> in the <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> documentation, we will enter in deep technical details in one of our next posts as well. Should you be interested in these, make sure you follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sequenceiq/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sequenceiq">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook">Facebook</a> for updates.</p>

<h3>SequenceIQ’s Azure REST API &ndash; open sourced</h3>

<p>At <a href="htp://sequenceiq.com">SequenceIQ</a> we always automate everything &ndash; and in order to launch VM instances, configure networks, start containers, etc we needed a REST client which we can use it from our JAVA and Scala codebase. Since the Microsoft API is XML based &ndash; <em>yo, it’s 2014</em> &ndash; we have created and open sourced a Groovy based <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/azure-rest-client">Azure REST API</a> &ndash; wrapping the XML calls into a nice, easy to use and clean REST API. Feel free to use it &ndash; it’s open sourced under an Apache 2 license. Note that <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> does not store your Azure user credential &ndash; whereas with the defulat Azue CLI that would have been possible &ndash; the only thing we need from your side to work is your subscription id. The process is documented here: <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#accounts.">http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#accounts.</a></p>

<h3>Metadata service for Azure</h3>

<p>The another nice feature we have created for Azure VMs is a <code>metadata service</code>. While a service as such does exists on Amazon’s AWS it’s missing from Microsoft Azure &ndash; note that our Cloudbreak solution is a cloud agnostic one, and we always strive to use identical solution on all cloud providers. The instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instances &ndash; and available via a REST call. We have developed a service as such for Azure &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/service/stack/connector/azure/AzureMetadataSetup.java">AzureMetadataSetup</a>. As you can see we collect the metadata, and make it available under a <code>unique hash</code> for each cluster by calling the following resource: <code>/metadata/{hash}</code></p>

<p>```java
private Set<CoreInstanceMetaData> collectMetaData(Stack stack, AzureClient azureClient, String name) {</p>

<pre><code>... try {
            CoreInstanceMetaData instanceMetaData = new CoreInstanceMetaData(vmName,
                    getPrivateIP((String) virtualMachine),
                    getVirtualIP((String) virtualMachine));
            instanceMetaDatas.add(instanceMetaData);
        } catch (IOException e) { ...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```
This service is used in a few cases &ndash; for example to learn different network setups as the hosts are using different network options than the Docker containers.</p>

<p>As usual for us &ndash; being committed to 100% open source &ndash; we are always open sourcing everything thus you can get the details on our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak">GitHub</a> repository.

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Docker ships Hadoop to the cloud]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/25/cloudbreak-technology/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-25T12:56:39+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/25/cloudbreak-technology</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A week ago we have <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/18/announcing-cloudbreak/">announced</a> and open sourced <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak</a>, the first Docker based Hadoop as a Service API. In this post we&rsquo;d like to introduce you into the technical details and the building blocks of the architecture.
Cloudbreak is built on the foundation of cloud providers APIs, Apache Ambari, Docker containers, Serf and dnsmasq. It is a cloud agnostic solution &ndash; as all the Hadoop services and components are running inside Docker containers &ndash; and these containers are shipped across different cloud providers.</p>

<p>Cloudbreak product documentation: <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak">http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak</a></p>

<p>Cloudbreak API documentation: <a href="http://docs.cloudbreak.apiary.io/">http://docs.cloudbreak.apiary.io/</a></p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>From Docker containers point of view we have two kind of containers &ndash; based on their Ambari role &ndash; server and agent. There is one Docker container running the Ambari server, and there are many Docker containers running the Ambari agents. The used Docker image is always the same: <code>sequenceiq/ambari</code> and
the Ambari role is decided based on the <code>$AMBARI_ROLE</code> variable.</p>

<p>For example on Amazon EC2 this is how we start the containers:</p>

<p><code>bash
docker run -d -p &lt;LIST of ports&gt; -e SERF_JOIN_IP=$SERF_JOIN_IP --dns 127.0.0.1 --name ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX} -h ${NODE_PREFIX}${INSTANCE_IDX}.${MYDOMAIN} --entrypoint /usr/local/serf/bin/start-serf-agent.sh  $IMAGE $AMBARI_ROLE
</code></p>

<p>As we are starting up the instances and the Docker containers on the host, we&rsquo;d like them to join each other and be able to communicate &ndash; though we don&rsquo;t know the IP addresses beforehand. This can be challanging on cloud environments &ndash; where your IP address and DNS name is dynamically allocated &ndash; however you don&rsquo;t want to collect these imformations beforehand launching the Docker containers.
For that we use Serf &ndash; and pass along the IP address <code>SERF_JOIN_IP=$SERF_JOIN_IP</code> of the first container. Using a gossip protocol Serf will automatically discover each other, set the DNS names, and configure the routing between the nodes.
Serf reconfigures the DNS server <code>dnsmasq</code> running inside the container, and keeps it up to date with the joining or leaving nodes information.
As you can see at startup we always pass a <code>--dns 127.0.0.1</code> dns server for the container to use.</p>

<p>As you see there is no cloud specific code at the Docker containers level, the same technology can be used on bare metal as well.
Check our previous blog posts about a <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/06/19/multinode-hadoop-cluster-on-docker/">multi node Hadoop cluster on any host</a>.</p>

<p>Obliviously there is some configuration on the host as well &ndash; for that and to handle early initialization of a cloud instance we use <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit">CloudInit</a>. We will write a blog post about these for every cloud provider we support.</p>

<p>For additional information you can check our slides from the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JanosMatyas/docker-based-hadoop-provisioning">Hadoop Summit 2014</a>.</p>

<p>Once Ambari is started it will install the selected components based on the passed Hadoop blueprint &ndash; and start the desired services.</p>

<h2>Used Technologies</h2>

<h3>Apache Ambari</h3>

<p>The Apache Ambari project is aimed at making Hadoop management simpler by developing software for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters. Ambari provides an intuitive, easy-to-use Hadoop management web UI backed by its RESTful APIs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/docs/images/ambari-overview.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ambari enables System Administrators to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Provision a Hadoop Cluster</li>
<li>provides a step-by-step wizard for installing Hadoop services across any number of hosts.</li>
<li><p>handles configuration of Hadoop services for the cluster.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage a Hadoop Cluster</p></li>
<li><p>provides central management for starting, stopping, and reconfiguring Hadoop services across the entire cluster.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor a Hadoop Cluster</p></li>
<li>provides a dashboard for monitoring health and status of the Hadoop cluster.</li>
<li>leverages Ganglia for metrics collection.</li>
<li>leverages Nagios for system alerting and will send emails when your attention is needed (e.g. a node goes down, remaining disk space is low, etc).</li>
</ol>


<p>Ambari enables to integrate Hadoop provisioning, management and monitoring capabilities into applications with the Ambari REST APIs.
Ambari Blueprints are a declarative definition of a cluster. With a Blueprint, you can specify a Stack, the Component layout and the Configurations to materialize a Hadoop cluster instance (via a REST API) without having to use the Ambari Cluster Install Wizard.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/docs/images/ambari-create-cluster.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3>Docker</h3>

<p>Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.</p>

<p>The main features of Docker are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lightweight, portable</li>
<li>Build once, run anywhere</li>
<li>VM &ndash; without the overhead of a VM</li>
<li>Each virtualized application includes not only the application and the necessary binaries and libraries, but also an entire guest operating system</li>
<li><p>The Docker Engine container comprises just the application and its dependencies. It runs as an isolated process in userspace on the host operating system, sharing the kernel with other containers.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/docs/images/vm.png" alt="" /></p></li>
<li><p>Containers are isolated</p></li>
<li>It can be automated and scripted</li>
</ol>


<h3>Serf</h3>

<p>Serf is a tool for cluster membership, failure detection, and orchestration that is decentralized, fault-tolerant and highly available. Serf runs on every major platform: Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It is extremely lightweight.
Serf uses an efficient gossip protocol to solve three major problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Membership: Serf maintains cluster membership lists and is able to execute custom handler scripts when that membership changes. For example, Serf can maintain the list of Hadoop servers of a cluster and notify the members when nodes come online or go offline.</p></li>
<li><p>Failure detection and recovery: Serf automatically detects failed nodes within seconds, notifies the rest of the cluster, and executes handler scripts allowing you to handle these events. Serf will attempt to recover failed nodes by reconnecting to them periodically.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/docs/images/serf-gossip.png" alt="" /></p></li>
<li><p>Custom event propagation: Serf can broadcast custom events and queries to the cluster. These can be used to trigger deploys, propagate configuration, etc. Events are simple fire-and-forget broadcast, and Serf makes a best effort to deliver messages in the face of offline nodes or network partitions. Queries provide a simple realtime request/response mechanism.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/docs/images/serf-event.png" alt="" /></p></li>
</ul>
